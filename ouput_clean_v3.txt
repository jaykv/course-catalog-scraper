This course explores the circumstances in which rational persons and political groups historically agree to be bound in collective decision making. The primary focus by examines four separate ethical themes illustrating why and how individuals accept a variety of terms.The course highlights philosophical/ethical decisions related to agriculture issues during the history of the United States. Issues range from non-interference rights to opportunity rights dealing with food, fiber, natural resource and environmental issues. Procedural theory emphasizes the formation of legitimate and defensible rules rather than ethics. Policy choices are assumed to be legitimate and defensible as long as individuals follow the rules/procedures for decision making. The content of this course meshes the procedural and the substance theories found throughout historical debates in agriculture communities. The course identifies traditional agrarian problem identification, policy formation, policy adoption and funding, program implementation and program evaluation.How ethics figures historically in agriculture policy processes is applied in a variety of case studies and debates as well as selected readings. The course includes an examination of the ethics of when, how and where the policy process historically influenced agriculture public policies. The course emphasizes the need to critically think about various points of view expressed by various conflicting authors.</p>"},

The course draws upon game theory and other strategic decision tools to analyze four broad types of strategic decisions, each of which corresponds with the four main parts of the course: 1)Strategic Decisions Between Rival Firms : Focusing on firm decisions made between rivals with full information, part one includes the following topics and strategies: limit pricing, entry deterrence, predatory pricing, excess capacity, wars of attrition, strategic commitment, tit-for-tat pricing, and retaliation. 2)Strategic Firm Decisions in an Uncertain World : Focusing on firm decisions made with incomplete information, part two, includes topics on probabilities, expected value and expected utility, learning curves, investment decisions, flexibility, and option value. 3) Strategic Decisions Between Unequal Partners: Focusing on firm decisions made between unequal partners with asymmetric information, part three includes topics on vertical coordination, incentive compensation, franchising, and auctions. 4) Cooperation and Strategic Alliances: Part four investigates how firms can overcome informational problems described above through the use of strategic partnerships. This writing, intensive course will rely on both class lectures and a substantial amount of class discussion. The course content will feature eight to ten industry applications and case studies of individual companies to reinforce economic theory. Learning Objectives- Students will: Classify practical agribusiness problems by the type of available information - full, incomplete, or imperfect and by the nature of market power in an industry. Construct and analyze game trees and other representative models of strategic decisions facing businesses and employees. Solve strategic business problems using economic models based on game theory and other economic principles.

The class mixes theory with practical knowledge and examples, and aims to create a balanced representation of the tools used in market analysis. The students learn how to find data, manipulate it and analyze and apply these skills to test the validity of simple economic models, to forecast commodity prices, to understand market trends and learn the use of derivative instruments to manage price risk. One objective of this class is to improve the understanding of economic modeling and to increase the familiarity of students when applying statistical functions and regression analysis to solve applied problems. These core competencies rely on previous knowledge of basic statistic tools and data manipulation. In the process, students will learn to analyze market fundamentals and better understand those forces that affect prices. This will also help them better understand supply and demand and the ability of market participants to adjust to changing conditions.</p>"},

These overarching topics include the structure of agricultural and environmental policies, the use agricultural land for biofuel production, organic agriculture, food safety, attitudes and policies surrounding the use of genetically modified crops, the role of large agribusiness firms, attitudes towards diet and health, and several others important topics. Students conduct background reading on these topics, hear lectures -- sometimes from guest presenters -- that frame the topics from both the U.S. and France\'s perspective, and write reports on specific crops or foods that expose key similarities and differences between the two food systems. Finally, students pick one crop or food for an oral presentation that contains background information on how that crop fits into the two food systems, U.S. and France, and analyzes the key issues that relate to the overarching topics already identified. This course has two components that must be taken in partnership: 470A (FOOD SYS US/FRANCE I) and 470B (FOOD SYS US/FRANCE II). The first is a classroom - based course, and meets regularly during the semester. The second is a two - week component that takes place after the end of the semester. In this second component, after traveling to France, students hear presentations from the French perspective on the overarching topics identified earlier and also explore the topics first hand via field trips to farms, wholesale markets, retail markets, and other places relevant to the French food system. This component is organized by a host university, AgroParisTech. For these two weeks, students live in dorms within the city of Paris. Knowledge of French is not required.</p>"},

Health of the environment and sustainable use of natural resources ensure the long-term well-being of human populations and so are central to sustainable community development. The practice of community development requires the ability to identify and understand the interrelationships of economy, society and environment locally, nationally and globally. Community development hinges on the capacity of local communities and residents to influence and determine their own futures. Students will gain an introduction to the concepts and models of community development and will become familiar with the roles of community development practitioners in developed and developing country settings. They will be able to identify the consequences of development strategies for social, economic and environmental well-being, focusing on the interrelationships of these aspects of development. Students will be introduced to strategies to identify capacity and resources available in communities and those that need to be enhanced. Models of decision-making will be introduced and students will work in teams in class with a focus on successful team functioning, identifying commonalities and shared interests to foster decision-making, and being able to extend that experience to working with groups in a community. Students will gain knowledge and understanding of the relevant concepts, processes and practice through readings and in-class lecture and discussion. Case studies of specific community development issues will give students the opportunity to apply the concepts and skills they learn in class, and to work in teams where students take on perspectives of different stakeholders and attempt to reach a resolution. Examples will be used throughout the course to portray important concepts.

Too often, colonizers around the world have ignored indigenous knowledge systems even though these ways of knowing have sustained peoples, cultures, and environments for thousands of generations. Because these ways of knowing are generally preserved and transmitted through stories, music, ceremony, and embodied traditions, they are seldom understood and frequently dismissed by those who control the production of knowledge in the modern world. The knowledge of the indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes region will, in this course, be presented as an empirically grounded scientific body of knowledge and theory comparable and complementary to the European tradition and, in specific ways, enhancing the sustainability of western scientific knowledge and practice. This course is a prerequisite for the Maymester field experience&amp;mdash;Exploring Indigenous Ways of Knowing among the Ojibwe (400B)--which offers students an opportunity to experience indigenous ways of knowing by engaging with Ojibwe educators, traditional knowledge holders, elders, and families among the Anishinaabeg of Red Lake, Leech Lake, and White Earth Nations, the three largest Ojibwe reservations in the US.</p>"},

Food is good if it can be manufactured at scale, distributed and sold at a profit. The qualities of the food can be defined in largely physical terms (e.g., price and costs, free from pathogens, certain levels of defined nutrients, good sensory scores, stability, and uniform and predictable properties). However, deservedly or not, food attracts more ethical attention than other goods.  For food scientists to fail to appreciate the different values, theirs and others, that impact arguments about food is harmful for (i) the food scientists themselves who may feel conflicted if they cannot resolve their personal preferences for food (perhaps local and organic) with the value set of their profession. (ii) the quality of the public conversation around food if scientists and technicians cannot usefully contribute their perspectives and (iii) the food companies that employ the scientists and who seek to make and sell products acceptable to a set of consumers. The first part of the course will focus on some foundational ideas useful to all controversies. A background in toxicology (or, if most of the projects are around the healthfulness as opposed to the risks of food, nutrition), epistemology in science, critiques of sciences, science as a social construct, ethics.

Their opinions are informed by the presentation of architectural materials and associated construction methods as they evolved - contextualized by human history and by their application in the built environment. In this class students are seeing the material and technological means of making architecture continuously altered by shifting human cultural desires and artistic/scientific/industrial developments.

Approaches to Digital Art is a survey class that will offer the web designer, cyberspace architect, MUD traffic controller or enthusiastic surfer an opportunity to examine the humanistic aspects of contemporary digital art. Through readings and direct interaction with digital media and digital artists, the class will develop an appreciation of the ways in which the interface between human beings and technology has been historically constructed and is subject to critical investigation. The goal of the class is to prepare each student so that she or he may engage with digital media in a way that is every more historically and socially self aware.Students will address the ways in which digital technologies transform artistic practices such as museum display, the writing of art criticism, the definition of works of art, changing role of the artist and the changing space of the art studio. More important, however, by engaging with digital works of art students will learn to think critically about technology and its engagement with culture at large. They will be encouraged to think about the political, economic and social impact of digital technologies. This humanistic approach to technology would make this course particularly useful to students of art history, philosophy, comparative literature, art education, and the visual/plastic arts. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to the ways in which art on the internet and digital art in general challenge the integrity of categories such as race and national identity. For example, students will have an opportunity to engage with African American artists such as Keith Obadike, whose on-line performances include an attempt to put his &quot;blackness&quot; up for sale on ebay.com in August of 2001. Students may also look at the ways in which net.art (Art made to be viewed on the internet) can critique commercial cooptation of global culture: etoy.com, for example, is an international and collaborative artist\'s group that satirizes global capital by camouflaging itself as a multinational corporation.This class will depend largely upon written responses and class discussion, rather than upon tests. Thus, students will learn how to approach difficult theoretical sources that have been assigned to them, and they will learn how to ask the kinds of questions that will help them understand such sources. This course will emphasize critical thinking rather than memorization, so students will develop analytical skills that will be useful in many other contexts.

The class is divided into two parts: 1) Each student submits a written proposal for a hypothetical magazine. In the proposal he or she describes the publication\'s subject, content and editorial point-of-view, along with the intended audience, must be described in the proposal. Additionally, the functional parameters surrounding editorial design and a discussion of similar publications in the marketplace should be touched upon in the paper. The proposal drives the design of the publication. Each student is required to develop an appropriate title for their magazine, design a masthead, two covers, a table of contents, and a minimum of three articles. The minimum length for each article is two spreads (four pages). All sections of the magazine will be bound together with one of the covers for final presentation. Additionally, each student must apply his or her masthead design to letterhead, envelope and business card. 2) Each student prepares for graduation and the beginning of his or her career by putting together their final portfolios, resumes, letters and job search strategies.The course will help students to: 1. Perform as editorial designers. 2. Prepare for the real working environment they will confront in the professional arena after graduation. 3. Thoroughly examine the design process and learn to clearly define the problem, in order to work logically towards an appropriate solution. 4. Develop the work habits and attitudes of professional designers. 5. Polish visual, verbal and written presentation skills. 6. Practice positive behavior, and conflict avoidance/resolution in the workplace. 7. Prepare designers for realistic working environment expectations. 8. Foster an appreciation of good typography.Grading: 1. Work will be evaluated based on the relevance and originality of the idea and the appropriateness of the design approach to the idea, the intended audience, and all pertinent functional parameters. 2. Professional attitude and the development of professional work habits will be evaluated. Students are expected to think for themselves, budget their time, meet deadlines, and adhere to production schedules. 3. Attendance is required. In the case of illness or an emergency, students are required to contact the professor just as they would contact an employer. Three unexcused absences will result in the final semester grade being lowered one full letter grade. 4. Neatness, craft and attention to detail will be considered in the final grade. 5.

At the core of the course are four general bodies of knowledge: Geometrics, Landform Manipulation, Site Systems, and Computer Applications for Site Analysis and Design.Geometrics: In order to perform landform manipulation, students must be able to efficiently acquire and process basic physical information about a site and are required to understand a suite of measurements. This course will first provide an overview of the digital and paper data sources available to landscape architects. Students will develop basic skills in manipulating or processing these data in order to comply with the requirements of site design. The course will also provide the basic measurements and formulae required for students to efficiently and accurately manipulate landforms.Landform Manipulation: One of the most critical skills landscape architects must acquire as designers is the ability to design landforms to accommodate changes in use and to translate their design ideas into dimensionally precise topographic representations of their designs. This course provides the basic knowledge for students to complete this process. Beginning with a single site element, students are expected to explore the suite of opportunities to place and modify a site to fit a single site element. Increased complexity is added to the suite throughout the remaining portions of the semester, thus enabling students to balance the opportunities and constraints presented by each individual design element and the overall site design.Site Systems: Building on ecological components of the curriculum, this course provides the first site specific and physical understanding of basic site systems critical to every landscape architect\'s design. Students will primarily focus on the major site features as related to site drainage, such as soil, topography, and surface geology, but will also be expected to recognize regional context in their designs.Computer Applications for Site Analysis and Design: A central component underlying the instruction of the course is providing students with a suite of computer tools.Course objectives: a) To assist in initial efforts in acquiring and processing site data; b) To perform calculations such as cut and fill, spot elevations, and slope calculations; c) To visualize and complete basic manipulation of landforms; d) To understand the interaction of physical site features on individual sites (e.g., soil and topography); and e) To communicate their final site designs according to professional standards</p>"},

The course is grounded in three basic concepts: RESEARCH, COMMUNICATION, and theoretical CONTEXT within the discipline of landscape architecture, past and present. The course develops the skills of critical thinking and writing as pertains to contemporary issues in landscape architecture, with an understanding of precedent and evolution of design theory. The goal of this course is to introduce students to a variety of ways that contemporary landscape architects address and use these issues in their work, and to develop their skills in critical thinking, the art of critique, and communicating ideas in both verbal and written methods. The course is devoted to a wide range of relevant issues and topics confronting the profession and discipline of landscape architecture in the 21st century. It investigates the modern designed landscape as a distinct mode of cultural production-with its own materials, medium, codes, ethics, and concerns-in the context of landscape architectural theory\'s interconnection to evolving societal constructions of nature, social issues, environmentalism, and the city. It begins with the emergence of a modern sensibility about landscape in the late 19th century and tracks developments through modernism, postmodernism, and beyond. Information dissemination will be by lectures, readings, student research in the form of monographs and critique of built work.</p>"},

This interactive digital design course is an advanced geodesign methods and principles class that applies digital tools to landscape research, modeling, analysis and design. This course presents a digital process for analyzing, managing, and ultimately designing landscape systems by allowing students to inventory, analyze and evaluate complex spatial datasets. Students will learn to critically evaluate and implement the interplay between various factors and design alternative futures. Lectures will introduce key geodesign principles and techniques. The goal is to investigate an array of geospatial software as a powerful design tool in a broad and integrated manner for all the activities of the landscape architect, designer, planner and architect. Using a variety of geospatial and digital tools, students will develop a process to study, analyze, and plan landscape systems. They will utilize activities from each lesson to develop primary and alternative strategies for their proposed project. The problem-based approach used by this course will encourage cross-cultural contexts for student projects. Geospatial design computing technology enables many alternate approaches to problem-solving, so that students will customize their own learning experiences within the concrete structure of the course. This course brings advanced geospatial and digital analysis and evaluation into the design process, where concepts and ideas are vetted for suitability against a wide array of physical and social, place-based information. This on-the-fly suitability analysis provides a framework for design, giving landscape architects, architects, land-use planners, and others involved with design the tools to directly leverage geospatial information within their design workflows.</p>"},

Designed landscapes and urban spaces are expressions of cultural values and environmental influences. Underlying all of the designs is the fundamental human connection to, and manipulation of nature as people create spaces that reflect political views, religion, are entertaining or provide personal inspiration and, most recently, show concerns for the health of the earth. While there is discussion of Middle East and East Asian landscapes, the course focuses upon Western civilizations with roughly the last third focusing on North American landscapes. The act of design and art often reveals a culture\'s beliefs, values, and aspirations. As well, the creation of outdoor places uniquely express a relationship between humans and nature. These designs and the many spaces they provide (e.g. plazas, campuses, gardens, cities, parks, memorials, urban systems, our own backyards, etc.) are aesthetic phenomenon that speak richly of cultural values. This is true throughout history as it is today. The stories these landscapes tell go hand-in-hand with cultural histories, but are not always closely examined. Designed landscapes enrich our daily lives enormously, but are not always observed, or understood as intentional acts of design--in fact they seem effortlessly placed before us. Successful landscape architecture accommodates human and natural functions (as does good building architecture), but the best speak to larger issues: to our minds and spirits. This course addresses the art of understanding the many layers of intent in designed landscapes from the past to present-including those that surround us as we walk through the built environment.</p>"},

The course is a survey of music history from antiquity to 1750, with readings, listening, and lecture. The principal objectives are: to acquaint students with important musical works from this period of European history; to place these works in their larger social, cultural, economic, and intellectual contexts; and to introduce analytical methods useful for describing technical musical features and relating those features to extra-musical concerns. As the second course in the music history sequence designed for music majors and minors, Music 261 forms a part of the core music curriculum required for advanced (400-level) study in the discipline.Assignments and evaluation methods are designed to help students develop their critical faculties and communication skills, through listening, reading, in-class discussion, examinations, and writing. There is significant emphasis on intercultural and international competence through study of music from a range of European countries. Musical analysis is integrated with consideration of the historical, social, cultural, religious, and economic circumstances of the works\' production. The course stresses development of criteria of aesthetic judgment, with respect to musical style (deployment of the various musical elements: melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, timbre) and the relationship of style to non-musical historical factors. The course is normally offered in the fall semester. It requires a piano and audio equipment.</p>"},

The popularity, significance, and value of film art would not be what it is today if music had not become an integral--indeed, indispensable--part of motion pictures from the outset. Preliminary objectives will include basic musical information (the fundamental elements of music; the broad stylistic eras of western music and their associated characteristics; the culturally encoded language of tonal music and associated musical meaning) and the main techniques of narrative film. The main objectives of the course are: to identify and recognize the principles of nondiegetic music in narrative film; to identify and recognize the purpose and functions of music in narrative film; to recognize some of the historic eras/genres/trends in Hollywood film making; to identify and recognize selected films, directors and composers; to analyze and articulate the role of music in a given scene and in a given film; and to recognize underlying assumptions and values of the culture conveyed through the diegesis. These objectives will be met by addressing such questions as: What are the underlying principles of music in film? What are the functions of music/sound within a particular scene and how does it achieve those functions? What do we see of what we hear, and what do we hear of what we see--and why? What secrets does music tell? To what extent does music influence--even control-- our interpretation of a film? More broadly, to what extent do films reflect our culture, past and present--our interests, our values? Evaluation methods will include quizzes, exams, discussion boards, and a final paper. The course will be available for GA credit. It will not satisfy any requirements for the major or minor in music. The films and film excerpts will be made available to the students online.</p>"},

MUSIC 005 is a course on listening, with emphasis on the relationship between musical style and historical context. The course begins with an introduction to the elements of music. The goal of this section is to give all students, whether they have previous experience as performers, the basic skills necessary to approach any musical work as intelligent listeners. This activity takes four weeks. The remaining portion of the course is spent surveying the history of Western art music, with that history treated as a series of case studies: particular works are considered stylistically with regard to the historical circumstances of their production and consumption. From this activity students gain experience considering artworks in discipline-specific terms, even as they learn to relate particular artistic features to nonmusical factors of culture and society. Three methods of evaluation are used. Four examinations test the students\' mastery of the course material. Four concert reports give students the opportunity to apply that knowledge to the act of listening in an authentic performance setting. An analytical paper presents a more detailed challenge, asking students to evaluate a relatively complicated work (such as a Mozart symphony), which they come to know intimately through repeated listening, using the basic technical tools of a music theorist. This requirement also includes a historical-research component. The course requires a technology classroom (typically it is taught in the Forum). It is offered fall and spring semesters, with an enrollment of 300 each semester.</p>"},

Students must learn to hear melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic patterns (audiation) before they sing, play or write in notation. In this introductory class, students are introduced to melodic, harmonic and rhythmic patterns by imitating the instructor who establishes these patterns at the piano, or by singing or as in the case of rhythm by striking a drum head. Eventually students will take turns &amp;quot;tossing&amp;quot; these patterns to teach other. Basic skills of improvisation can also be taught at this level of audiation by having students expand upon the basic patterns.As a result of these creative and aesthetic experiences, students will be able to translate the audiation of patterns into musical notation - moving from the smallest unit of a rhythmic motive towards the creation of a coherent rhythmic phrase. Similarly, at the melodic level, the student will begin with intervallic patterns and move towards the creation of a coherent melodic phrase. Intervals are then combined vertically to form harmonies. At the next stage of learning, students will learn to identify and to write that which they are hearing in dictation.This course in &amp;quot;musical literacy&amp;quot; enables students: (1) to deepen their appreciation of music (2) to begin studying a musical instrument and (3) to enter the rigorous study of music theory required of music majors</p>"},

Emphasis is placed on the development of a personal jazz dance style, exploration, and self-expression. Jazz dance, as a technique class, has at its core, increasing the strength, alignment and flexibility of each dancer. Each semester the dancer will be introduced to different styles of jazz which will require a changing perspective of the body and its&amp;rsquo; movement. Movement classes will be supported through viewing a variety of the dance styles being studied. In each style, daily movement experiences will be introduced to build coordination, flexibility and strength, as well as the understanding of the particular jazz dance idiom. These experiences will take place in the center floor, across the floor accumulations, and culminate in a combination of all these experiences in a dance to develop their potential as a performer. Connections to the social aspect of jazz dance will be consistently addressed, as all dance forms are vernacular in origin. Jazz dance, being a true American dance form, has its roots in the late 1800&amp;rsquo;s and early 1900&amp;rsquo;s with a pre-history in Africa and West Indies. The desire for self-expression through physical movement drove the dance form to a formal art expression on the concert stage. This connection to the vernacular has been maintained in the jazz dance idiom. The exploration in Jazz Dance emphasizes the individual expression through movement in response to music particular to the style being presented in each semester.</p>"},

The primary goal of the course is to help students develop a critical and analytical approach to dealing with the dramatic arts of the contemporary mass media. The course presupposes some familiarity with modern popular media and takes as its content both historical and contemporary examples as sources for analysis. While the class offers facts and data, the central focus of the course in the theory, stylistic elements, and structural workings of media content. The pedagogical goal of this approach is to examine not just what the mass media arts are but also where they come from, how they function, and what effects they have on our culture and society. The key to this goal is understanding the effects and influence of dramas in the mass media on our society and its beliefs and values. Class meetings consist of lectures and in-class discussions that illustrate modern critical approaches to popular culture and the terminology used in presenting critical arguments and ideological viewpoints on the dramatic arts of the mass media. Reading assignments will support classroom work by presenting students with a diversity of opinion on mass media and the influence of television dramas and comedies. Further, examples of historically significant radio and television dramatic works will be shown in class and then discussed in relation to the concepts and critical viewpoints covered in lectures. In addition to regular scheduled classes, students will participate in an on-line Television Journal that requires watching and critically responding to assigned television programs. Each week, students will be required to watch and critically respond to assigned television programs.

Each student will synthesize the experiences and understandings developed through prior courses in the undergraduate art education program. - Students will become aware of emerging trends in art education and reflect on implications of those trends for their future teaching and learning. Each student will complete, and publicly present, a teaching and learning portfolio that includes evidence of professional preparation, biographical information, samples of artwork and writings on art/visual culture, and reflective statements explaining the selection and significance of specific items. Students will gain understanding of the importance of professional standards and practices in art education. Student learning will be evaluated through assessment of the preprofessional teaching portfolio, and through a combination of written assignments, individual and small group oral presentations, and active participation in class discussions. Students will collaborate on a final installation, performance or exhibition demonstrating their readiness for the final internship. Since this is the final course in the major prior to student teaching or the internship, attendance is very important and will count toward part of the final grade. Students need access to a computer lab. The capstone course in the art education major should be taken in the final semester before student teaching or a final internship. Since one goal of the course is helping students synthesize what they have learned in their prior courses, successful completion of all of the required courses in the major is prerequisite to enrollment in the capstone course. Students will have been introduced to the teaching and learning portfolio in their introductory art education course and should have developed pieces for their pre-professional teaching portifolios in most of their earlier art education courses. Much of the work of the capstone course will, therefore, focus on reflection, refinement, and synthesis.</p>"},

The objective of the course is to develop in the student both an appreciation and understanding of contemporary art through an examination of art and contemporary social, cultural, and political issues surrounding artistic practice. Students will respond to the ideas presented in the lectures by completing a series of artworks intended to reflect the issues and concepts that have been presented. The intended, though not exclusive, audience for the course is non-art majors. While the focus of the course is a critical examination of both the artworks studied and the artworks created by the students, the critique will be derived from the various backgrounds and academic experiences of the students and not necessarily from their knowledge of art. In this manner, the course can become a relevant complement to all of their studies. In short, the goal of the course is to understand art as a means to critically engage and begin to understand our surroundings and not simply as an end product. Evaluation of student achievement will be done in both the classroom and studio portions of the course. Since it is not expected that students have a background in art, content knowledge assessment will primarily be based on the students\' active participation in class discussions as well as objective tests in the form of written responses to the issues and concepts examined. In the studio, their work will be judged on how well students have responded to the concepts and issues explored as well as on their ability to articulate their own ideas in relation to those of other students and other aesthetic and cultural ideas to which they have been exposed.

Approaches to Digital Art is a survey class that will offer the web designer, cyberspace architect, MUD traffic controller or enthusiastic surfer an opportunity to examine the humanistic aspects of contemporary digital art. Through readings and direct interaction with digital media and digital artists, the class will develop an appreciation of the ways in which the interface between human beings and technology has been historically constructed and is subject to critical investigation. The goal of the class is to prepare each student so that she or he may engage with digital media in a way that is every more historically and socially self aware.Students will address the ways in which digital technologies transform artistic practices such as museum display, the writing of art criticism, the definition of works of art, changing role of the artist and the changing space of the art studio. More important, however, by engaging with digital works of art students will learn to think critically about technology and its engagement with culture at large. They will be encouraged to think about the political, economic and social impact of digital technologies. This humanistic approach to technology would make this course particularly useful to students of art history, philosophy, comparative literature, art education, and the visual/plastic arts. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to the ways in which art on the internet and digital art in general challenge the integrity of categories such as race and national identity. For example, students will have an opportunity to engage with African American artists such as Keith Obadike, whose on-line performances include an attempt to put his &quot;blackness&quot; up for sale on ebay.com in August of 2001. Students may also look at the ways in which net.art (Art made to be viewed on the internet) can critique commercial cooptation of global culture: etoy.com, for example, is an international and collaborative artist\'s group that satirizes global capital by camouflaging itself as a multinational corporation.This class will depend largely upon written responses and class discussion, rather than upon tests. Thus, students will learn how to approach difficult theoretical sources that have been assigned to them, and they will learn how to ask the kinds of questions that will help them understand such sources. This course will emphasize critical thinking rather than memorization, so students will develop analytical skills that will be useful in many other contexts. Because students will be given weekly writing assignments, they will be able to improve their skills in composition.</p>"},

INART 062 West African and African American Arts: From the 1960\'s to the Present (3) (GA;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course focuses on the interrelationship and parallel development of arts in West Africa and the United States from the 1960s to the present. The cultural ties between the slave trading states of West Africa and the slaves and their descendents of the Americas, though weakened by over three centuries of separation, were never completely erased and the similar experiences of colonial oppression in Africa and slavery in America created expressions in art of remarkable similarity and correspondence. Although this comparable and often equivalent development in artistic expression on both sides of the Atlantic was, by and large, unrecognized and unacknowledged, the emergence of black nationalism in the 1960s reestablished the historic cultural associations between African and African American arts and created a remarkable artistic interchange that continues to the present day. The 1960s was a pivotal period for both African and African American art. The Civil Rights movement in the United States and the collapse of colonial rule in West Africa gave rise to a new sense of black identity for Africans and those of African descent and a new art that embodied and expressed that newfound identity. During the 1960s, the visual, performing, and literary arts of Africa and Black America celebrated their shared cultural heritage and found common use as instruments of political and social change. The sense of shared history and like experience on both continents influenced and informed black art in powerful ways and continues to motivate and inspire artists as they reflect and comment on their geographically separate, though spiritually linked, worlds. This course focuses on works of art drawn from many diverse traditions in both Africa and the United States and sets those works in the context of the social, political, and cultural movements that helped to create them. Examples of African and African American visual, performing, and literary arts will be examined, compared, and contrasted in order to gain insight into those works while serving as a vehicle for gaining a better understanding of the cultures that created them. INART 062 is a wholly online course that will be offered simultaneously by Penn State and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Ghana. This will allow students in Africa and the United States to participate as members of the same class in discussions and joint projects created on the World Wide Web.

The course accomplishes this through photographic and written explorations of social, political and ethical issues relevant to photography. Photography wields unprecedented influence as a primary visual medium and students constantly use photography in their personal lives as both a communications tool and as a creative outlet. The ubiquitous smart phones with built in cameras are responsible for much of this explosive popularity with social media providing appealing venues for publicly displaying photography. Over the first decade of the new millennium, social media sites saw the volume of photo uploads increase dramatically, eventually exceeding 10 billion per month. In light of photography being a key medium students use to share and communicate information about themselves to the world at large, the course is designed to help them to think critically and ethically about the photographs they take, share, view and use. The major course teaching topics will address a broad range of contemporary issues relevant to how photography and culture affect one another. Students will become aware of photography as a constantly evolving medium, whose relatively short historical trajectory has culminated in the development of an easily accessible egalitarian art form that bridged the digital divide to interact intimately with personal computing, cell phone communications, the Internet, and social media. In the course, students will take photographs to fulfill photographic assignments, share them with peer audiences, and then engage in critical conversations regarding the aesthetic and communicative meaning and effectiveness of the photos. They will also engage in written assignments where the course presents them with case studies regarding current issues in photography such as, the impact of technological developments in the medium, ethical uses of photography, photography as free speech, and photography as social media. Students will conduct research on the topics and develop informed written position statements, which they will share with their classmates for peer evaluation and feedback. In addition, students will engage with selected readings regarding aspects of photography addressed in the major teaching topics.</p>"},

Emphasis will be given to understanding the context that surrounds the scientific and aesthetic development of photography. This is a survey of the chronology of events in western culture that transpires from the inception of photography until the year 2000. It includes the influences and outcomes of photographers and those associated with the medium on our culture. Emphasis will be placed on the influence of photography on the world around it, and significant events and individuals in the development of the medium as a vital art form. The structure of the course will consist of research and discussion of events and individuals that characterized years selected for examination. Each week one or two decades of western culture will be highlighted. Although the thrust of research will relate to photographic subject matter, the events studied will span the culture. We will explore the development of art, literature, music, and photography, as well as, historic landmarks, and the events that have shaped present society. Each week a selection of visual material will be presented highlighting selected events, students will read literature from the period of discussion, significant pieces of music will be introduced, and accounts of periodic events will be surveyed.Each week, a group of students will be assigned to research at least one decade. Each student will gather information about a significant figure or event that occurred in the course of a given period. The student will be expected to prepare a short paper and give a five-minute oral presentation about his/her assigned year, historical figure or event. As each student presents, the chronology of events becomes clear and the multiple threads of history weaves a brilliant tapestry of our culture. For the final presentation the student will prepare a ten-page research paper about a historical figure or event.Students will be graded on the quality of the weekly oral presentations and the demonstrated level of commitment to research. Another significant part of their grade will be derided from the length of committed scholarship given to the ten-page term paper. Students must exhibit a level of originality, clarity, and insight. The student must demonstrate the capacity for the assimilation of facts and events relative to their subject and demonstrate how their subject relates to other events that occurred around the same time of their event.

Students will be introduced to the photographic techniques; professional practices; creative sensibilities; and cultural knowledge significant to the work of a professional photographer and fields reliant on or related to professional photography.  The course content focuses student attention on mastering the technical fundamentals of professional photography in the context of the photographer/client relationship. The learning problems place emphasis on the communication, collaboration, and cooperation necessary to solve visual photographic problems in a professionally oriented setting. Under these conditions, students must collaborate with their clients to foster creatively productive relationships and meet their photographic needs.  This problem requires developing communication and interpersonal relation skills, which require clearly understanding the clients\' needs and educating them about the creative possibilities and limitations. Under this teaching and learning model, students must learn to merge their own creative vision with the needs and desires of their professional clients. These skills are directly applicable to the real world problems students will encounter in professionally oriented circumstances after they graduate.  In the learning problems student peers, with the instructor\'s guidance, will play dual roles of clients and photographers with the goal of concentrating the photographers\' attentions on communicating with their clients to create effective and creative purpose-driven images. Consequently, the course places a greater emphasis on communication, collaboration, and cooperation than it does on personally and individually motivated expression.  Since the advent of digital photography, the medium has undergone an unprecedented period of technological, creative, and cultural flux. Digital photography, computer technology, and social media have had dramatic impact on the medium, which we expect will continue into the future. Consequently, we have used a problem based learning approach to ensure we can continuously address the most relevant and current topics and information. We have also chosen major teaching and learning topics, which will continue to meet the fundamental needs of the students even as technology continues to shift.  At the beginning of each semester, students and the instructors will work collaboratively to develop five student learning-problems. These problems or projects will address the major teaching and learning topics under a variety of conditions designed to reinforce the subject matter, encourage flexibly creative thinking, and allow students to pursue the subject with greater critical depth and awareness.</p>"},

After they graduate, students will be able to continue using these critical skills to learn and experiment with new techniques, which drive the constantly changing styles in photographic design and thus keep their work looking fresh and current. They will additionally develop and hone visual and verbal skills necessary to critically analyze their own photos and the photos of their peers. The course will culminate with students producing professional portfolios of their work suitable for career purposes.</p>"},

Trends in effective self-marketing and professional presence change over time with shifts in cultures, styles, and technologies. The Internet has given rise to global niche markets as well, which photographers often accommodate. As a result, there is no clear one-size-fits-all approach to this inconstant problem. We have chosen to apply a problem-based learning approach to this course with the intent that students will work with their instructors and peers to tailor the course learning problems to be relevant to each individual student and still meet the course learning objectives. To achieve that, in collaboration with their instructor and peers, every student will design five individualized capstone projects specifically pertinent to his or her situation. Each project will directly address at least two of the course major teaching topics. Much of the work of the capstone course will focus on reflection, refinement, and synthesis.</p>"},

It generally involves the investigation and analysis of financial data for some specific purpose - obtaining an in-depth understanding of information that enables the forensic accountant to prove, disprove or at least confidently speculate about allegations related to the information and to report those findings objectively. Forensic accountants are involved in presenting analyses that might be valuable for such things as settling legal disputes, calculating economic damages, valuing intellectual property, determining the extent of damage or loss due to fraud, or tracing elusive assets or revenue sources. A forensic accountant might also participate in pro-active engagements such as the development of systems and procedures to prevent fraud.

Students will consider the roles of drivers such as cost, quality, time, flexibility, innovation and information sharing in designing supply chain strategies in support of overarching business strategies. Through detailed exploration of models, case studies and real world events, coupled with the application of operations management tools and techniques, the course provides the opportunity to identify and dissect issues, and develop solutions to supply chain challenges not only faced by today\'s business managers, but also impact the customer. The course examines supply chain organization, implementation and management planning, the evaluation and control of manufacturing processes, and the execution of supplier and customer management activities. Students will use basic information technologies and programs to leverage tools like business process mapping, value indexing, and total cost analysis to aid in the identification and mitigation of supply chain issues in a global business environment. Students will also be exposed to current supply chain issues such as sustainability and the impact of boundary-spanning information technologies as relevant keys to competitive advantage. The course provides the basic supply chain knowledge and skills necessary for the non-business major to be an effective member of a cross functional team in a professional business environment while providing a level of understanding to benefit the student in navigating the complex customer fulfillment issues present as a consumer of goods and services in today\'s globally connected marketplace.

It covers a range of topics from the basic (what is marketing), to the processes (market segmentation, marketing strategy, development of product, price, place and promotion), to the broader societal questions (why marketing exists, ethics, the future of marketing). There is also the opportunity to examine marketing from the perspective of various industries for non-business students. Assessment will test factual knowledge of marketing and the marketing process. Written assignments will ask students to work both individually and in teams to apply course concepts. These can include assignments developing one\'s skill set in consumer psychology, target market selection, writing a positioning statement, developing a marketing plan, new product development concepts, promotional campaign ideas, and ethical questions to discuss and debate.

Students will utilize the fundamental concepts learned in finance (integrated with accounting, marketing, management, logistics, operations, and business law/ethics) as a foundation for running a business in the classroom. The &quot;product&quot; in this business will be a comprehensive strategic business plan for a real, live local, state, national, or international business that will serve not only as an articulation of understanding of core course concepts, but also as a supplement to the existing core package of introductory business courses. The honor students in this course will be building their strategic business plan products in electronic format in closely-knit, high performance teams. The strategic plan product development process in this course inherently involves integration across the functional areas of business: marketing, logistics, finance, and management. There is also inclusion and integration of courses in accounting, business law, management information systems, and statistics as applicable. Each student team will allocate product development responsibilities according to areas of expertise and interest. An appropriate balance of students from several majors will be assigned to each group. Class time will involve exchanging information within and across groups and coordinating activities between groups where necessary. Students will periodically meet with individual and team-based corporate mentors who will provide one-on-one advice on an as-needed basis. Students will also receive specialized training in team-based processes, leadership, and technology tools required to implement the products under development. Select members of the Penn State faculty and Smeal College alumni will be on hand at times to provide this specialized training and consulting expertise. Company owners and principals will provide periodic (monthly) reviews of honor students\' work to assist them in the development of a first-class, professional business plan product.</p>"},

Specific assignments include: putting together the weekly reports for investors, creating reports that are sent out to the Nittany Lion Fund (NLF), and providing assistance with pitches. In general, an Associate Manager is supposed to be well informed about the sector\'s current holdings and with that, an Associate should be able to provide support for the Lead Manager during a stock pitch or class discussion. Although Associate Fund Managers are the workhorses of the fund, often performing some of the more tedious tasks, the position offers the opportunity to learn from the Lead Managers as well as make an impression by delivering quality work. While Lead Managers are responsible for and have the final say in stock pitches and sector strategies, it is highly encouraged that the Associates provide their Lead Managers with pitch ideas as well as inform them of their opinions about current market trends. Ultimately, the Associate Manager position is more detail and task oriented than the Lead Fund Manager position. However, there is always room to provide high quality insight into the market by asking thought provoking questions during pitches and staying current on market news. Students use financial software, such as Bloomberg Professional, Reuters Station, TradeStation, and FactSet, and must have working knowledge of various forms of financial modeling. The Penn State Investment Association (PSIA), which co-exists with the Nittany Lion Fund, LLC (NLF) assists the NLF in ensuring students are appropriately trained in these skills. The PSIA is open to students of all majors and experience levels and is the starting point for students interested in participating in the NLF.</p>"},

The course focus is on creating portfolios of assets rather than on picking individual assets for investment. To create a portfolio of assets, the portfolio manager must have knowledge of the assets available for purchase, the markets the assets are traded in, and the statistical and mathematical techniques needed to assign weights to the assets within the portfolio. The manager must also be able to predict changes in the economy that justify changes in the portfolio, as well as be able to evaluate the performance of the portfolio relative to standard benchmark portfolios such as the S&amp;P500.The course begins with a review of the structure of the asset markets, basic pricing formulas, fundamental and technical analysis, and the tools from previous statistics, economics, and calculus classes needed. Different models relating risk and return such as the CAPM and arbitrage pricing model are covered. These models exemplify how investors are willing to trade-off the variance in returns from investments with the expected value of the investment. The students then learn how to choose the weights to assign to each asset available to maximize the expected return while minimizing risk of the portfolio using the portfolio theory of Markowitz. While the focus of this section of the class is on investing in equities, the portfolio theory learned is applicable to all types of assets. Because there are important differences between stocks and bonds, the next section of the class focuses on the unique characteristics of fixed income securities. Models explaining the different risk and return characteristics of bonds are examined. Because fixed income securities prices and returns are directly linked to changes in interest rates, theories of what determines interest rates are presented and applied to evaluating the performance of portfolios including fixed income securities. The course concludes with an overview of investment in options and futures contracts. The basic pricing models for these types of assets are reviewed as well as practical concepts of investing in derivatives such as margin accounts and creating synthetic returns using combinations of different types of options.As an Honors course, the level of research and academic investigation is enhanced with outside journal readings in topics such as portfolio theory, anomalies and market efficiency, overpricing, and current topics in Portfolio Management as material is published. This material is incorporated into class discussions and course exams beyond what is covered in the standard version of the class.</p>"},

ENGR 426ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 Invention Commercialization (3) The goal of ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 is to have students understand why invention commercialization is complicated and difficult by participating in the process. For example, the inventor rarely has insights into the markets for his/her invention, is often not interested in the details of commercialization, and can be secretive. In addition, the business and financial communities often do not take the time, or have the resources, to understand new technologies and perform complex due diligence. Thus lack of due diligence often leads to rejection of innovation because existing companies often discount new technologies from outside the company as NIH - &amp;quot;not invented here&amp;quot;.Effective transfer of new invention or innovation to a commercial product requires at least three different functional communities to interface: technical, legal and business. Each uses a different language, comes from different educational and cultural backgrounds, and may have an inherent distrust of the others. These functional barriers are difficult to overcome.This course teaches how these barriers can be broken down as student teams help bridge the perceived chasm between key players in the invention commercialization process. In these teams, students bring the skills and knowledge from their major to develop an invention commercialization recommendation for the Technology Transfer Office and the inventor. For example, business students focus on finance and market opportunity assessment; engineering and IST students focus on design refinements, prototyping support, and (if appropriate) making technology suggestions to the inventor.Upon completing the course, the students will have a working knowledge of different university and corporate technology or invention commercialization processes, important intellectual property management tools for inventions (patents, license agreements, option agreements) source of funding to move inventions toward product development, and delivering top quality presentations which outline the recommended commercialization path.

The second topic might be how the internationalization of the structure and role of Boards of Directors in multinational firms contribute to globalization, and challenge the cultural norms in those organizations The third topic might be how North American firms have been forced to adjust their product packaging, in response to environmental impact laws in Germany, and how this shifts the locus of the product message from point-of-purchase to alternative media.</p>"},

The course examines how regional integration, through the EU, has shaped industrial, competition, monetary, and related economic policies, and how Europe\'s international trade and finance capabilities affect the global economy.  As a result, a significant part of the course focuses on the evolution of the EU, its institutional structure, and its impact on business (both European and foreign).  The course also compares business-government relations, models of capitalism, and corporate governance in individual European countries, using the United States as a basis of comparison.  Particular attention is given to France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, and how their business environments differ from each other.While the primary focus of this seminar will be on these themes, we will use articles from the Financial Times and similar publications as the basis of discussion in each class for a range of topics related to Europe. The approach taken in this course is a multidisciplinary one, with the assumption that business executives must understand the political, cultural, institutional, historical, and geographic aspects of Europe if they are to be successful in the business environment of Europe.Students are expected to be active participants in class discussion.  Readings usually will include a textbook, readings packet, and a subscription to the Financial Times .  Evaluation will be based on a combination of participation and attendance, exams, quizzes, a group project, and essay assignments.</p>"},

With an understanding of historical events that have shaped the political and social landscape of modern day Africa, the economic potential of African nations will be discussed in detail. Utilizing success stories, the course introduces economic, business, social, and political issues that confront developing countries in Africa, along with solutions that have been proposed or are in use to address various development challenges. This course will provide students with the opportunity to learn first-hand about international development issues. It will introduce students to definitions of international development terms, data on international development, measures of development and development indices, as well as leading issues in International development. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course explores some of the key development issues in sub-Saharan Africa, examines empirical findings to better understand Africa and its nations, and reviews the prospects for successful international business in this emerging growth market. Cases studies focus on successful economic growth that have emerged out of Africa and what how these successes are laying the groundwork for future international business opportunities. As such, the various components of the course are designed to promote the student\'s abilities to: -Describe and analyze social, economic, political elements that influence development in African countries. Students will learn that development problems, while often measured in economic terms, are multi-faceted and interrelated, thereby learn to appreciate that meaningful analysis and problem solving in international development must include different components. -Identify and analyze specific global issues, illustrating the social, economic and political context that may affect their resolution. Students will have the opportunity to experience the different facets of international development and participate, in a limited way, in efforts to address the issues.</p>"},

In this course, you will learn how to conceptualize decisions involving risk, how to analyze your choices, how to estimate the risk, and how to communicate and defend your analysis to others. The skills and tools you will learn come from economics, probability, statistics, and game theory. The focus will be on how the tools from these fields are applied to real world business decisions in risky environments. The concept of risk diversification will be discussed under both independent and correlated risks. Decision rules such as expected value maximization and expected utility maximization will be covered. The role of risk aversion of the decision-making process will be discussed along with how it can be measured. The study of decision analysis will include the use of decision tress. The basic concepts in game theory will be introduced. Students will learn what a Nash equilibrium is and how to derive such an equilibrium. More complicated games with incomplete information will be introduced which are important in decision-making where parties often are missing key pieces of information but must still choose a business strategy. Problems of asymmetric information will be studied; these situations arise when one party to a transaction or contract has more information relevant to the decision than the other party. For these types of problems, such as adverse selection and moral hazard, optimal solutions will be discussed.</p>"},

R M 440 Risk, Strategy, and Decision Making (3) One of the key ways that a business attempts to manage risk it anticipates and confronts in markets is through organizational-level elements such as its business strategy, structure, and culture. These elements emerge from a series of decisions guided by the insights and biases of individuals. As such, the management of enterprise risk must also include an understanding of how individuals (e.g. managers) approach risk through their decisions and decision making processes. In this course, we look at some of these critical elements separately and then together as they integrate to guide and define enterprise risk management. The basic course objectives are to come away with an understanding of the following: Forms of strategic risk &amp;ndash; From market to internally-driven risk; from emotional to economic-driven, how does strategic risk present itself? How do executives recognize/assess and respond to the &amp;ldquo;portfolio of risk&amp;rdquo; that they must address to make the business successful? Business strategy and structure &amp;ndash; One way risk is addressed and articulated is through a business strategy. What is strategy? What are the key decisions that comprise a business strategy? How are organizations structured to implement these strategies and move information across the firm? Where and how is risk assessed in these processes and structures, and incorporated into a strategic risk plan? Decision making &amp;ndash; Decision making around strategy and risk management plays out in various forms and across different levels (i.e., individuals and groups). What goes right and wrong? How are these processes systematically linked to perceptions and actions associated with risk management. Organizational culture &amp;ndash; Perhaps one of the most critical elements in enterprise risk management is the role played by organizational culture (or simply &amp;ldquo;How we do things around here and my role as an organizational member doing it.&amp;rdquo;) We examine the roots of organizational culture and how it is aligned to perspectives of risk and its management. Descriptive vs. prescriptive perspectives &amp;ndash; Once we &amp;ldquo;described&amp;rdquo; what does/could go on, we need to engage in looking at ways that organizations can prevent pitfalls and correct suboptimal practices.</p>"},

Increasingly, however, the field has expanded to include a wide variety of broadcast, wire-based and wireless forms of video, data and voice communications. The rapid convergence of previously disparate industries and services, especially the melding of television, telephone and Internet systems, will be a dominant theme in the course. At the same time, a global system of electronic communications has been steadily evolving. This class is also about the dynamics of that changing system; it is about the origins of the telecommunications system, and its future. To better understand these developments, we will examine powerful interacting forces that are shaping the world of information by drawing on history, economics, technology studies, politics, and culture.While the course is intended primarily for Telecommunications majors planning careers in these fields, all students will benefit from the course by learning to critically analyze media structures and programming and to better appreciate the importance of ICTs (Information, Communication and Technology) in their lives. This course serves both as an introductory core course for students in the Telecommunications major and as a broad social science course for students in other departments across the university.

In its first three semesters, the class has gone to Mexico City and Shanghai, and Cape Town, South Africa. The course has been approved as an embedded program by the Office of Global Programs. Admission to the course is highly selective and open only to junior and senior journalism majors. Students must apply for admission and present examples of their work as well as recommendations by a member of the journalism faculty.The aim of this course is to help young journalists acquire the skills they will need to compete in an industry where increasingly the threads of even the most local stories either come from, or lead, overseas. This is not a course aimed at training students to become foreign correspondents. Rather, we hope to prepare students to function in a foreign environment, and to recognize, overcome and ultimately benefit from the linguistic, cultural, economic and legal challenges that working in another country will entail.The course has three segments. In the first half of the semester we study the history, culture, politics and economics of the country to which we are traveling. We also develop and refine our ideas for the stories we will report when we get there. We will also learn about foreign reporting and how it differs from the reporting we have been used to doing here. The second part of the course consists of supervised travel to our target country. Here, we report the stories we have selected, file blogs and video posts to ComMedia, and also meet with local journalists, officials and students of the host country. Depending on the country in which we are working, students also have the opportunity to collaborate, when appropriate, with students from local universities. The final half of the semester is devoted to supervised individual work aimed at turning our reporting into stories suitable for publication or broadcast.Although students are required to acquire a general working knowledge of the country to which we are traveling, and will be tested on it, in the end they will be evaluated almost entirely on their work product. This results-oriented approach has been chosen because it most closely replicates the environment of a professional newsroom.</p>"},

Emphasis is placed on the role that Kinetics, heat transfer, mass transfer, and fluid dynamics have on flame structure and flame stability. The course includes some laboratory demonstrations of flat flame and diffusion flame burners, and incorporates numerical calculations of thermodynamic and kinetic combustion phenomena. The course begins with a review of transport phenomena, physical gas dynamics, and thermochemistry. Then, the concept of the laminar flame speed is introduced in the context of a one-dimensional flame and a propagating chemical wave. Issues of premixed flame structure and stability are presented along with a discussion of flammability limits. Next, laminar diffusion flames are presented via the Burke-Schumann analysis. From laminar flames, the emphasis shifts to turbulent premixed and diffusion flames, and the concepts of flame stretch and strain. Detonations are considered, with emphasis on thermodynamic analysis of the detonation and the structure of the detonation wave. Details of chemical kinetics for the hydrogen-oxygen and hydrocarbon-air reaction systems are presented, with linkage back to earlier topics such as flame stabilization and flammability limits. After kinetic phenomena, the course then considers pollutant formation focusing on soot and NOx. The fundamental aspects of combustion are applied to analysis of the combustion process and pollutant formation in international combustion engines and catalytic combustors. The course wraps up with discussion of atmospheric chemistry, the fate of pollutants, and the formation of secondary pollutants.</p>"},

P N G 450 Drilling Engineering (3) This course addresses a critical issue in petroleum and natural gas engineering: of how to drill and complete oil and gas wells in an engineering sound, economical, and environmentally safe manner. Drilling technology has advanced greatly since the first commercial oil well in the U.S. was drilled in northwest of Pennsylvania in 1859. The true vertical depth of the well has grown from 69.5 feet from then to more than 15,000 ft, with the deepest at more than 40,000 feet. The horizontal length of a well has grown from theoretically zero to more than 10,000 feet, with the longest at 40,000 feet. The temperature and pressure of the formation that petroleum engineers need to drill through could easily reach 350 0F and 20,000 psi or higher, and the formation and fracture gradient window becomes narrower, all making drilling and completion more challenging. In summary, it is becoming increasingly more challenging to drill wells. Thus, engineering design becomes more critical. The objectives of this course are to introduce the students science of drilling and completion. This includes learning the fundamentals of drilling fluids and drilling fluid design, and applying fluid mechanics and quantify drilling hydraulics for complex fluid flow through drilling string and annular spaces. The course will also discuss the concepts and quantify the formation pressure and fracture pressure gradients for different methods of drilling. A key task for students will be to learn the methods for characterization, selection and optimization of casing design, and optimized bit design, and finally the course will discuss how to design directional and horizontal wells to optimize production and recovery from mature fields and unconventional resources, such as coalbed methane, shale gas, and tight oil in Pennsylvania.This course is a prerequisite for petroleum and natural gas engineering major courses.

Particular emphasis is given to developing an integrative view of how atmospheric, hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes control the patterns of climate, water, landforms, soils, and biota across a local-to-global continuum. Those physical elements that influence and/or are influenced by people are the primary focus of study.Physical geography does not simply discuss the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere in isolation; instead, it concentrates on understanding theintegrationof these realms of the natural world. For example, the study of weathering processes demonstrates how the physical and chemical breakdown of Earth\'s surface material depends on the interaction of air, water, and biota with rock.The focus of physical geography is unlike the component disciplines from which it draws. On the one, hand, meteorology focuses on the atmosphere above our heads. Hydrology focuses on water in isolation from people. Geology and soil science focus on the Earth beneath our feet. Biology and ecology focus on the plants, animals, and ecosystems in isolation from people. One the other hand, physical geography concentrates on the surface of the Earth where the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere intersect.Introduction to Physical Geographyis concerned with the human habitat-the life layer in which humans interact with their natural world.Like all geography, five recurring themes permeateIntroduction to Physical Geography : location, place, regions, movement, and human-environment relationships. Physical geographers not only are interested in where natural phenomena are located on Earth\'s surface, but also they want to know the answers to such questions as:1. What is special about the physical processes that take place in a location? 2. How does the physical geography of a place relate to other places in the region? 3. How does energy and mass flow into and out of a region? 4. How do biophysical processes change as we move up and down spatial scales? 5. How do people influence natural processes? How do these processes influence people?Other disciplines typically do not cover these spatial and nature-society themes systematically.Physical geographers have developed and adopted many tools to address these themes. Maps are obvious choices, but geographers also use a wide array of photographic and imaging technologies to study the distribution of Earth processes and the processes themselves. They use geographic information systems and computer models to manipulate, display, and analyze spatial data.Introduction to Physical Geographyacquaints students with many of these tools.When the above points are taken together, physical geography emerges as a unique field of science.Introduction to Physical Geographyprovides a learning experience that students can get in no other discipline-one that takes an integrated view that makes the nature environment relevant.</p>"},

GEOG 3GEOG 301 Thinking Geographically (3) The course explores the process of thinking geographically. As a discipline that draws on elements of four intellectual traditions - the physical sciences, the social sciences, the information sciences, and the humanities - geography offers an extensive palette of approaches to the study of the interactions among people, places, and environments. In addition to those traditions, geography also draws on key themes: setting events and activities into multiple spatial and temporal contexts; setting events and activities into multiple spatial scales from the local to the global; seeing complex, multi-way interactions between human and physical systems; recognizing the interconnectedness between places. In terms of methods, the fundamental building block is the idea of geospatial location and the associated spatially- or geo-referenced data. Data, both quantitative and qualitative in character, is increasingly available in terms of amounts and quality.

In addition, students are encouraged to think critically about environmental problems and discover the complexity of these issues. An emphasis on the discrepancies between political rhetoric, media reporting and scientific data provides students the opportunity to evaluate conflicting arguments for themselves.The goals of this course are (1) to develop students\' understanding about our Earth and human effects on natural resources, (2) to foster the ability to critically evaluate scientific arguments, and (3) to practice expressing reasoned opinions on complex problems. To achieve these goals, grades are based on examinations, homework assignments, written reports and oral presentations. Exams use a traditional multiple choice format and are based on the lecture and readings. However, questions are designed to test a student\'s knowledge of the principles and interrelationships discussed rather on memorization of facts and terms. Homework assignments are given on approximately a weekly basis. Questions cover the most important concepts of the text and lecture and encourage consistent reading to complement lectures. These exercises have two purposes. First, the short answer nature of questions provides practice in writing logical, concise paragraphs while ensuring the student understands key concepts. Second, assurance that students are reading chapters concurrent with the lecture topics allows the instructor to interact with the class more effectively during class discussions. Two written reports are given to test a student\'s ability to comprehend scientific articles and explain the science and its implications for environmental policy. A wide variety of topics are suggested based mainly on newspaper and magazine articles on environmental issues, but students can select almost any topic related to the environment with prior instructor approval. Students must then research the science behind the media coverage via library and web-based resources. The class web site (http://www.geosc.psu.edu/People/Faculty/FacultyPages/Kubicki/earlOO.html) is designed to facilitate searches related to course topics. Papers are judged based on the clarity of writing, the quality of scientific data included, and discussion of the implications of the research. Oral presentations debating two sides of environmental issues will be conducted. Small teams (4-5 students) will be assigned one side of an issue and each member will participate in a debate against another team. These debates will develop students\' speaking and team-building, skills. Although each student will be responsible for a section of the debate, factual research will be carried out as a group to present the best overall case.</p>"},

We will use the popular media as a starting point for discussions and development of tools for analyzing the causes of disasters. Using excerpted segments of &amp;quot;disaster films&amp;quot; in conjunction with scientific treatments, we can identify the causes, consequences and public perceptions of natural hazards. Small group discussions and cooperative research held &amp;quot;real time&amp;quot; in the classroom will be a major component of this course. The goal is to help students develop both an understanding of natural hazards and disasters, and enhance their understanding of scientific approaches to problem solving. During the course approximately four to five topics selected from the list of volcanoes,, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, bolloid (e.g., asteroid) impacts, and tsunami (tidal waves) will be covered. For each topic, we will incorporate the following activities: (a) short edited excepts from disaster movies (or equivalent) of approximately 10 minutes each; (b) discussions by small groups of students (approximately 10 per group) to identify scientific issues to be addressed; (c) development of scientific background and tools via faculty lectures, tutorials, and library or web-based activities; (d) cooperative learning activities by small student groups--each group working together to address one of the identified scientific issues; (e) group presentations of results of the cooperative learning activity; and (f) individual writing activities producing focused reports on specific scientific issues. A typical topic will be covered in three weeks (six class meetings) with approximately 50 percent of the time (in class) allotted to group activities and discussion; lecturing by the faculty will involve approximately 25 percent of the time, with the remaining 25 percent of the time used for video and Wed-based presentations. Grades will be based on participation in &amp;quot;breakout&amp;quot; group discussions and cooperative activities, writing assignments ( (two to three pages each) associated with each topic, and an annotated &amp;quot;disaster diary&amp;quot; of natural disasters which have occurred during the course. Each writing assignment will be aimed at a client audience (e.g., municipal government, businesses, or the general public) and written to explain the exposure to natural hazards or potential for disaster faced by the client. This course has no prerequisites and should be accessible to all students. Through cooperative activities students can benefit from the range of expertise brought to the course by their colleagues and thus address scientific issues beyond the reach of any individual.</p>"},

The course includes the study of Earth\'s gravity and magnetic fields, focusing on how they reveal the internal structures and dynamics related to plate tectonics. The basic physics and mathematics of plate motions are also explored in some detail. We will also examine the elastic properties and behaviors of rocks, which form the basis for understanding seismic waves, rock fracture, and fault slip. The next major topic of the class is the flow of heat through the solid Earth system, involving the study of conduction, convection, and advection. The study of heat will provide the basis for understanding the application of simple differential equations with boundary conditions to geological processes; this will also introduce the mathematics of diffusion, which will permeate much of the course. This study of diffusion will enable us to move from steady state conditions to non-steady state conditions that typify most geological settings. We will examine the fluid dynamics relevant to the flow of the mantle and less viscous fluids at the surface such as lava flows and glaciers. The fluid dynamics will also lead us into an exploration of the basic physics of ocean circulation, stream flow, and erosion on land. Throughout the course, students will learn how to use calculus and very simple computer programming in MATLAB to provide a quantitative framework for understanding the physical processes that shape the Earth. The class involves a weekly lab that involves several field trips to make measurements using a variety of geophysical instruments to solve problems related to gravity, stream flow, and heat flow. Other lab activities involve studies of rock friction and fracture, ocean currents, glacial flow, seismology, and plate motions.</p>"},

A main goal is to demonstrate to meteorology students that the ocean is not a static, passive lower boundary to the atmosphere but a dynamic, evolving entity that is intimately coupled to the atmosphere through the exchange of heat, momentum, and water. Thus the oceans affect weather and climate. Students are evaluated on their comprehension of the relevant physical processes (as determined by written examinations) and by term papers and laboratory reports or a combination of the two.

Foucault is arguably one of the pre-eminent Western social theorists of the 20th century. Researchers and theorists working from post-structural, critical and socio-cultural perspectives frequently turn to Foucault\'s concepts of power, discipline, and subjectivity as powerful analytic lenses for analyzing the daily lives and practices of students and teachers in classrooms as well as more generally the field of Education, educational politics and policies, and educational institutions. Additionally, given the tremendous impact of Foucault&amp;rsquo;s work in multiple disciplines throughout the academe, the ability to read and apply the theories of Foucault can facilitate broader reading and discussion across a variety of disciplines. In the class, students will devote approximately 2/3 of the time to reading original works by Foucault and brief commentaries on these works, and 1/3 of the time reading applications of Foucault\'s work by education researchers and theorists.

The course is the discipline-specific component of the Secondary Education block taken by majors in Secondary Education prior to student teaching. In this course, students explore issues in language, literacy, and culture and development of curricular designs for teaching language arts in secondary schools. Through in-class and out-of-class activities completed both independently and in collaboration, students read about, talk about, and practice teaching all of the language arts&amp;mdash;reading, writing, speaking, listening, and thinking. Activities highlight ways of planning for instruction and ways of assessing student learning as teachers implement those plans. In addition, students will take up the professional issues facing beginning teachers of the English language arts&amp;mdash;issues of professionalism and the teaching role, relationships with students, and how teaching can fit into a life. The course builds upon content developed in other courses in the major, including theories of reading, composition, media literacy, and pedagogy. Students engage in a variety of writing tasks both in support of developing course content and as a means of making their work public. This writing includes (but is not limited to) lesson planning, reflective writing on experiences both in the course and in related field experience, and the development of a professional portfolio. During class sessions, informal writing is used for a variety of purposes such as brainstorming, facilitating collaborative work, or framing discussion. Throughout the semester, students draft and receive feedback on a variety of portfolio components, which are revised and incorporated into a final version of the portfolio due at the end of the course.

Effective work in these arenas requires knowledge and practical skills about professional development and institutional change as well as awareness of policies and the role of policy in influencing practice.Students study research and practice in teacher education and professional development of mathematics teachers. They come to know the research and the issues that confront those who prepare teachers and support teachers\' continued professional development. Students become familiar with governmental and professional organizations and the critical issues that impact the direction of mathematics education. They also learn how to study local, state, and national policies and publications.This course would be one of four required Mathematics Education courses for all doctoral students in the Mathematics Emphasis Area/Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. program.

Throughout the course, students engage in a series of investigations that lead towards the development of evidence-based explanations for patterns observed in the current Solar System. Investigations will include computer-based simulations, night-sky observations, and use of simple laboratory equipment. These investigations lead students towards an understanding of how observations of the current Solar System can be explained by the model of its formation. The course is designed to build from students\' own personal observations of the day and night sky towards developing increasingly sophisticated explanations for those phenomena and beyond. Conducting these astronomy investigations will help students understand fundamental aspects of physics, thus broadly preparing them for future science teaching in these domains.

SCIED 411W Teaching Secondary Science I (3) Science Education 411W is an introduction to secondary science education. The course is a project based course for individuals planning to teach science in grades 7-12 and has a significant emphasis on professional writing. The course is also appropriate for those interested in teaching or in program development of out-of-school science learning environments (e.g., science centers, nature centers, museums). Students will participate in activities that are designed to help forge a \'philosophy of science teaching\' that is supported by research based findings on 1) learning and assessing learning, 2) best practices for teaching, 3) images of science and scientific inquiry, and 4) the effective design of lessons and activities. There are several peer-teaching assignments where students teach each other and two student teaching assignments with middle school children from area schools. Students are expected to complete written reports and reflections on-type assignments for lesson plan reviews, curriculum assessments, science research reports, and clinical interviews. One of the major goals of <a href="/search/?P=SCIED%20411" title="SCIED&#160;411" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, \'SCIED 411\');">SCIED&#160;411</a> is to promote \'reflection in action\' and \'reflection on action\' among the students. These are two constructs put forth by Donald Schon that argues an important meta cognitive dynamic for teachers is to think about what they are doing while teaching (in action), and to also think about what they will do differently in future episodes of teaching (on action). On each occasion in 411 when students compete a peer teaching or clinic teaching experience they are requested to compete a \'reflection writing assignment\'. Criteria for success on the writing assignments is 1) to provide an accurate description (which may include a lesson plan or references to the lesson plan) of the teaching; 2) to diagnose and identify the successes and the shortcomings of the lesson in terms of student learning; 3) to make connections to course readings that offer suggestions for adapting the lesson to promote learning. The reflection assignments are typically 2 to 3 single-spaced pages accompanied by the lesson plan. Across the semester, from the first \'reflection\' assignment to the last \'reflection\' assignment there is an expectation that the 411 students will demonstrate a increasing depth and sophistication of reflection, analysis and attention with respect to the construction of learning goals and instruction strategies that promote working with students prior knowledge, employing formative assessment tasks to make students\' thinking visible, and using questions and strategies that frame a student-centered discourse learning environment. The course professor will grade the written assignments and provide written and oral feedback. Each assignment will be revised and posted to an on-line student portfolio. Written communication is important in the field of education and science. In this course, the importance of written communication as a means to learn and reflect on the subject matter of the science disciplines and on teaching is emphasized. The value of scientific reports, analysis of curricular materials, development and reflection on lesson plans, and statements regarding the student\'s philosophy of science teaching will be evident through written assignments, feedback, and revision. Through the experience of reading, discussion, development of lessons, and practice teaching, students will develop the ability to do the following: (a) Use appropriate techniques to probe students&amp;rsquo; prior knowledge and understandings of scientific concepts. Knowledge about students\' alternative conceptions and intuitions is then used to design effective lesson plans and assessments. (b) Plan and teach science lessons employing sound research-based techniques for inquiry teaching. Students will complete both peer and student teaching assignments that are videotaped. (c) Prepare written reflections and evaluations that incorporate analytical perspectives that are based on personal experiences and on course readings and research-based frameworks and practices. Students will be offering written reflective comment on their own teaching and that of classmates. The course goals include the ability to develop a \'reflection in action\' and \'reflection on action\' decision-making orientation that is informed by evidence-based practices linked to student learning.</p>"},

During this course, candidates learn to be critical of their own learning, instructional design, and teaching. Candidates use this to revise their practice as they grow as science teachers.&amp;nbsp;The course activities, assignments, readings, and placement experiences offer multiple opportunities for candidates to learn essential knowledge and practices to support children&amp;rsquo;s curiosity about the world.Course assignments and in-class experiences are designed to help teacher candidates understand the importance of engaging their future students in a strongly integrated focus on science content and practice. This encompasses both how scientists work (the practice of doing science and building our knowledge of the world) and how children learn the skills and practices of doing science. Helping children understand the practices of science is of equal importance as helping them learn the content of science.To start understanding ways of supporting children in learning to do science in age-appropriate ways, teacher candidates in this course contrast their understanding and experiences with those of children. Assignments are designed to help facilitate exploration of the links between understanding children&amp;rsquo;s prior knowledge and beliefs, using knowledge of how people learn, and making pedagogical choices to move children towards specific content and practice goals. Candidates consider the role of differentiated instruction and methods of assessment in science teaching. Finally, the course examines methods of adapting science curriculum using knowledge of children and specified learning goals. Teacher candidates bring together what they have learned about the practices of science, social constructivist instructional methods, and assessment to think critically about how to support elementary students learning science across time. <a href="/search/?P=SCIED%20458" title="SCIED&#160;458" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, \'SCIED 458\');">SCIED&#160;458</a> is a part of a block of courses in a PSU teacher education program that is unified by a basic set of principles and a field experience component.</p>"},

Students are expected to rigorously participate in whole class and on-line discussions about the meanings expressed in the films. These discussions will be coupled with and enhanced by the instructor\'s presentation of relevant concepts of leadership and organizational theory. Students are also expected to maintain a continuing reflective log of each film\'s plots and characters, the practical and theoretical problems presented, and their own reactions to and ideas about each film. Using these logs as a starting point, students will be expected to write three short (3-4 pp.) essays and one more substantial final essay (10-12 pp.). Rather than simple plot narratives, it is expected that these essays will thoughtfully analyze and synthesize actions and concepts from the films, and attempt to apply them to school or other organizational settings.

The course has been developed to fulfill requirements of Pennsylvania Department of Education and in recognition of the growing number of English Language Learners (ELL) in the general population and thus in special education settings. The course presents (1) theory and research on the instructional needs of English Language Learners (ELLs) and (2) the knowledge base on effective instruction for students with special needs and assists students to integrate the two. Major topic areas include principles and issues in second language acquisition; ELL characteristics including linguistic and cultural factors that affect second language acquisition; techniques and methods of research-based instruction for English Language Learners with special needs; lesson planning and instructional modifications for ELLs with special needs; and appropriate assessment practices for ELLs with special needs. A major objective of this course is for students to be able to develop or modify instructional plans that reflect evidence based practices for adapting for the needs of ELL learners with special needs. Evaluation will be based on a combination of methods including, tests and quizzes, analyses of videos and case studies and reports of observations and interviews.</p>"},

The purpose of this course is to expose students to the key principles and methods of experimentation as related to the field of aerospace engineering. Students learn the fundamentals of measurement techniques to determine quantities such as temperature, force, pressure, displacement, velocity, acceleration and strain in various laboratory situations. The course employs weekly &amp;quot;set-up&amp;quot; experiments that provide an opportunity for students to familiarize themselves with modern measurement techniques and gain valuable experience regarding the calibration and use of aerospace engineering research equipment. Students are expected to apply their knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering in order to complete successfully the experiments encountered in the laboratory. The subsequent interpretation and analysis of the laboratory data requires the use of standard engineering tools and practices. Students work in lab groups to process data and then identify, formulate, and solve engineering questions associated with the experimental results.Throughout the semester, students communicate their knowledge and understanding of the course material through a series of class assignments, written technical reports, and one final exam. Because writing and revising laboratory reports significantly enhances the understanding and interpretation of the research data, this course is &amp;quot;writing-intensive.&amp;quot; As such, students are expected to improve their writing skills as they gain experience writing abstracts, informal reports and formal reports. Peer review of reports helps students to recognize good writing, and to learn how to provide constructive criticism. The course instructor provides written feedback for revised formal reports, and the quality of writing is a factor in determining final grades.</p>"},

It includes documentation, management, processes, requirements, design models, computer programs, validation, verification, and other aspects of the development process.Aerospace systems, including aircraft, spacecraft, onboard avionics, ground-based systems, flight simulators, and air transportation systems, rely heavily on software. Software is a major cost of all aerospace systems. For example, the Boeing 777 has more than 1000 onboard processors and more than 4 million lines of software which is primarily written in Ada. The F/A-22 fighter has more than 2 million lives of software onboard, and much of this is Ada also.Aerospace systems also demand a level of reliability far beyond that of most other systems, which means the software must be designed using rigorous mission-critical and safety-critical procedures, which makes the software quite unique compared to most other software.

A E 551 Combined Heat and Power System Design for Buildings (3)Building systems consume about 40% of the primary energy resources utilized in the United States each year and are responsible for a proportional fraction of air contaminants (NO, SO, fine particulates, CO) and greenhouse gas, CO,. A conventional energy supply mix for building (grid electricity, site fossil fuel heating) results in approximately 50% primary fuel energy utilization. Advances in scalable, low emissions, electric power generating devices are leading to incorporating on-site power production into the building design. The &amp;quot;waste heat&amp;quot; general is of such a quality that it can be utilized at the site in heating, hot water, absorption cooling, and dehumidification applications. The simultaneous utilization of a primary fuel to generate both the electrical and thermal components in Building Combined Heat and Power (BCHP) can result in total primary fuel utilization values of 85% or greater, electric power reliability increases and significantly reduced emissions, particularly greenhouse gases. This course examines the underlying thermodynamic principles involved in BCHP, pollutant and greenhouse emission mechanisms and levels associated with both Separate Heat and Power (SHP) and BCHP designs for a given building site. Economic and regulatory principles that govern the application feasibility of a BCHP design for a given building configuration are examined. At the end of the course, students will have the skills and tools necessary to perform an assessment of the feasibility of a BCHP application to a given building site. Specific combinations of distributed, electric power generation equipment (micro-turbines, fuel cells, diesel engines, wind-power) and thermal &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; utilization from these generating systems will be discussed and analyzed.

The skills developed in the course build on the knowledge of fluid mechanics and building mechanical systems. The course will also add to the available pool of electives for students in the integrated BAE/MAE program.The first part of the course covers general CFD topics on the solution of Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Different concepts necessary for the solution of the partial differential equations expressing the conservation laws will be introduced along with a CFD software package. In this phase, the course focus will be on the derivation of different equations and their solutions. Analytical solutions will be derived when possible, while most of the problems will require use of numerical solutions. Several homework assignments will require development of small computer programs. The introduced CFD software package will prepare students for the second part of the course that is more applied.The use of CFD in building design is different from its use for other engineering applications because of the domain size and specific boundary conditions such as diffuser airflow, wind, or solar radiation.

The objective of this course is to introduce the student to digital design using Field Programmable ICs, and to provide an understanding of the underlying technologies and architectures of these Integrated Circuits.The course begins by introducing design alternatives for modern electronic systems identifying and classifying alternative system solutions, and evaluating when particular design solutions are optimal. These alternatives include microprocessors, microcontrollers, off-the-shelf digital ICs, Programmable logic ICs (FPGAs and CPLDs), and various forms of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designs. A homework assignment requires the student to quantitatively evaluate the cost, complexity, packaging, and time-to-market issues for a complex system design specification.Next, the underlying Field Programmable Logic IC architectures and technologies are studied in detail. Following a broad survey of available programmable IC vendors and on-chip programming technologies (and their cost/performance trade-offs), several specific case studies are presented in the class. The first is the Xilinx XC4000xl line, because of the target boards used in the CAD laboratory component for this class. The initial lab portions of the class help the students to specify their design using various forms of design entry tools and also allows them to see how their design map on to the underlying FPGA architecture. The students also learn the underlying algorithms used by the design software they use in their Labs.Next, the systematic top-down method for specifying complex designs using VHDL is introduced. Students are given a supporting homework assignment to develop high-level behavioral models for a simple digital system to reinforce this segment of the course. VHDL behavioral synthesis is now introduced as a preferred path to go from high-level system behavior to actual implementation on the FPGA. The strengths and weaknesses of synthesis are discussed, as are the emerging CAD tool trends. Additional VHDI-based homework assignments reinforce behavioral design and synthesis using commercial CAD tools.The final segment of the class covers special topics that identify current trends in digital system architecture and programmable logic design. These include such topics as partially reconfigurable architectures and dynamic reconfiguration techniques, system design for testability, and field programmable analog arrays. Applications of FPGAs in special purpose computing environments such as signal processing, Java acceleration and image processing are also introduced. In the laboratory, student design project assignments explore larger and more complete system specifications of such things as controllers, CPU and memory design, and signal processing blocks. These assignments reinforce the lecture content as the students model, synthesize and implement their digital designs on the target Xilinx FPGA boards.</p>"},

Example problems will be drawn from a variety of sources, including brain teasers, puzzles, and mathematics. We will show how these problems and their solutions apply to real problems involving computers. We will also explore a number of the important areas of computer science and computer engineering including Boolean and Digital Logic, Designing Arithmetic Hardware, Cryptography and Security Programming Languages, Networking and Wireless Communication, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Ethics.</p>"},

This course will provide information and experience required to understand, design and implement components of large software systems.In general, students should be able to evaluate design alternatives according to standard practice, specifications, performance analysis, robustness, etc. To concentrate attention, we investigate one system and one programming language in detail, through demonstration programs, short- and long-term programming assignments. The specific system is Unix, a family of operating systems forming a complete standardized programming environment based on the idea of software tools. The specific language is C, which is widely used for operating system implementations, and which forms the basis for the C++ and Java languages studied in the prerequisite courses. This will help students understand operating system services available to application programmers, and provide a firm ground for study of operating systems in general.There are several themes of the course:(1) Understand computer systems, especially low-level influences on high-level goals. This includes the machine-level representation of programs and data structures; the memory hierarchy and its impact on performance; access to stored information via file systems, and access to other computer systems via networks.(2) Understand existing system software and software standards, especially the UNIX toolset. This includes preparing a program (editors, static analysis, development environments); running a program (compilers and interpreters, assembler, linker, loader, debugger, profiler, tracer); controlling parts of a program (memory management, threads); communication between programs (within one system using signals, between systems using sockets and communication protocols); and combinations of software tools with scripting languages.(3) Understand &quot;real code&quot;, such as selections from the Linux operating system kernel and GNU utilities and libraries, and through comparative selections from Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X.(4) Understand system performance, including experiments on program performance and optimization techniques.</p>"},

The course studies regular languages by means of deterministic and nondeterministic finite-state automata and regular expressions; it studies context-free languages through the use of context-free grammars and pushdown automata; and it studies computability by means of Turing machines and recursive and recursively-enumerable languages. The unsolvability of the halting problem for Turing machines is proved by a diagonalization argument, and this result is then used to show that various problems about languages are unsolvable, such as the problem of determining whether two context-free grammars generate the same language. Finally, the concept of computational complexity is introduced, and the classes P and NP are defined. (Informally, the former class consists of problems that can be solved computationally in a manageable amount of time, and the latter consists of problems for which a proposed solution can be verified in a manageable amount of time.)

After a discussion of threats of systems security, we will examine the fundamental mechanism for access control, the reference monitor. We will define the principle of the reference monitor and review how it is used to implement access control. The second major topic is mandatory access control (MAC). We will examine the implementation of MAC in Linus via the Linux Security Modules (LSM) framework. This part of the class relies heavily on a case study of the SELinux system to illustrate how MAC can be implemented and how security goals can be enforced by using MAC. The third major topic focuses on how network security functions are implemented in the operating system. Such functions include authentication, firewalls, and secure communication via IPsec. The implementations of such functions in the Linux operating system will be the focus of this particular section of the course. The third major topic examines system security architectures for distributed systems. The main foci are mechanisms based on public key systems, such as trust management, integrity measurement, and web-based operating systems. We will investigate research results in these areas and hypothesize where this emerging space may evolve. The fourth major topic focuses on lower level features of operating systems and their impact on security. We will first review virtual machine systems and recent research results that indicate an emergence of virtual machine mechanisms as a practical basis for achieving strong systems security guarantees. We will then explore work on protecting access to data on systems that is resident in traditional (file systems) and unexpected (other temporary) storage locations. The final two sections, Special Topics and Wrap-Up, will cover a number of areas of importance to system security, but not really falling into the traditional system areas. This includes emerging topics such as language-based security, the use of source code analysis for achieving system security goals, host intrusion detection, and emerging areas of recent interest. These topics will change over time as interests and technology develop. We will conclude with a discussion of the major challenges and state of system security, and make predictions about the future of system security.</p>"},

The material in this course is needed for further study in image processing and data communications, both of which are major areas of specialization within the computer engineering curriculum.This course is divided into three main sections - continuous-time linear system analysis, sampling and reconstruction, and discrete-time (digital)linear system analysis. Although the material covered in the first and last sections is similar, fundamental differences between continuous- and discrete-time exist. One of the goals of this course is to make the student aware of these differences.The first part of the course discusses continuous-time linear system analysis. It begins with basic time-domain mathematical descriptions of various signals and systems. The bulk of the analysis, however, is in frequency domain approaches such as the Fourier Series and the Fourier Transform. Applications such as modulation and multiplexing are understood much easier using frequency-domain analysis approaches.The middle part of the course deals with the bridge between continuous- and discrete-time, namely signal sampling and reconstruction. Theoretical and practical approaches to sampling/reconstruction are covered. Finally the Nyquist sampling theorem, which is the key to all digital signals, is developed. At this point, students are ready to study discrete-time systems.The final part of this course revisits system analysis, although now discrete-time (or digital) systems are considered. As in the continuous-time case, both time-domain and frequency-domain approaches to the analysis problem are discussed. The course ends with select topics in the z-transform, which is the digital counterpart to the Laplace transform.</p>"},

The course emphasizes integrated circuit process-compatible circuit design techniques in recognition of the amazing synergy that has characterized the relationship between modern circuits and integrated circuit processing technology. This course is the third in a series of three courses dealing with the analysis and design of electronics circuits, following E E 310 and E E 311. E E 410 includes three lectures and a two-hour laboratory each week.E E 410 begins with a deeper look into several key concepts previously considered in earlier course work, such as node voltage and mesh current methods for solving circuits, which are emphasized throughout the course. The small-signal method is revisited and thoroughly examined. The more advanced Ebers-Moll bipolar junction transistor model is introduced and the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor device model is reviewed.The next phase of the course introduces the vertical geometries of integrated circuit devices commonly used in linear circuits. Unwanted parasitic devices that are introduced as a result of the integrated circuit processes are revealed and their effects on circuit sign techniques operation are discussed. Both the limitations and the opportunities provided by integrated circuit technology are examined, particularly in the light of de used to minimize the problems and to take advantage of the features.The last half of the course is devoted to applications of linear circuits, especially those which students have not previously encountered. The first topics in this series are analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion. Various methods of accomplishing each of these functions are examined. The inverse relationship between speed and accuracy is emphasized. These topics are followed by studies of switched capacitor filters, phase lock loops, analog multipliers, and voltage-controlled oscillators.The emphasis of the laboratory component of the course is to successfully accomplish a student-chosen linear circuit design project.

CMPEN 417CMPEN (E E) 417 Digital Design Using Field Programmable Devices (3)Field Programmable Devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs) are widely used for rapid prototyping and quick response-time designs. The objective of this course is to introduce the student to digital design using Field Programmable ICs, and to provide an understanding of the underlying technologies and architectures of these Integrated Circuits.The course begins by introducing design alternatives for modern electronic systems identifying and classifying alternative system solutions, and evaluating when particular design solutions are optimal. These alternatives include microprocessors, microcontrollers, off-the-shelf digital ICs, Programmable logic ICs (FPGAs and CPLDs), and various forms of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designs. A homework assignment requires the student to quantitatively evaluate the cost, complexity, packaging, and time-to-market issues for a complex system design specification.Next, the underlying Field Programmable Logic IC architectures and technologies are studied in detail. Following a broad survey of available programmable IC vendors and on-chip programming technologies (and their cost/performance trade-offs), several specific case studies are presented in the class. The first is the Xilinx XC4000xl line, because of the target boards used in the CAD laboratory component for this class. The initial lab portions of the class help the students to specify their design using various forms of design entry tools and also allows them to see how their design map on to the underlying FPGA architecture. The students also learn the underlying algorithms used by the design software they use in their Labs.Next, the systematic top-down method for specifying complex designs using VHDL is introduced. Students are given a supporting homework assignment to develop high-level behavioral models for a simple digital system to reinforce this segment of the course. VHDL behavioral synthesis is now introduced as a preferred path to go from high-level system behavior to actual implementation on the FPGA. The strengths and weaknesses of synthesis are discussed, as are the emerging CAD tool trends. Additional VHDI-based homework assignments reinforce behavioral design and synthesis using commercial CAD tools.The final segment of the class covers special topics that identify current trends in digital system architecture and programmable logic design. These include such topics as partially reconfigurable architectures and dynamic reconfiguration techniques, system design for testability, and field programmable analog arrays. Applications of FPGAs in special purpose computing environments such as signal processing, Java acceleration and image processing are also introduced. In the laboratory, student design project assignments explore larger and more complete system specifications of such things as controllers, CPU and memory design, and signal processing blocks. These assignments reinforce the lecture content as the students model, synthesize and implement their digital designs on the target Xilinx FPGA boards.</p>"},

ENGR 426ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 Invention Commercialization (3) The goal of ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 is to have students understand why invention commercialization is complicated and difficult by participating in the process. For example, the inventor rarely has insights into the markets for his/her invention, is often not interested in the details of commercialization, and can be secretive. In addition, the business and financial communities often do not take the time, or have the resources, to understand new technologies and perform complex due diligence. Thus lack of due diligence often leads to rejection of innovation because existing companies often discount new technologies from outside the company as NIH - &amp;quot;not invented here&amp;quot;.Effective transfer of new invention or innovation to a commercial product requires at least three different functional communities to interface: technical, legal and business. Each uses a different language, comes from different educational and cultural backgrounds, and may have an inherent distrust of the others. These functional barriers are difficult to overcome.This course teaches how these barriers can be broken down as student teams help bridge the perceived chasm between key players in the invention commercialization process. In these teams, students bring the skills and knowledge from their major to develop an invention commercialization recommendation for the Technology Transfer Office and the inventor. For example, business students focus on finance and market opportunity assessment; engineering and IST students focus on design refinements, prototyping support, and (if appropriate) making technology suggestions to the inventor.Upon completing the course, the students will have a working knowledge of different university and corporate technology or invention commercialization processes, important intellectual property management tools for inventions (patents, license agreements, option agreements) source of funding to move inventions toward product development, and delivering top quality presentations which outline the recommended commercialization path. Students who enjoy open-ended projects which involve the interplay of business and invention of who wants to work on interdisciplinary teams with the newest inventions will find this course a valuable course. NOTE: Because the inventions/products are based on Penn State faculty intellectual property, students must sign the Penn State Special Intellectual Property Agreement For Students - For Use When Assigning Intellectual Property to The Pennsylvania State University.

This course is the second course in a two-course sequence (BB H 501 and BB H 503) that is designed to provide first-year graduate students with a multidisciplinary understanding of the biobehavioral health perspective. This views humans as complex dynamic systems of integrated component processes that interact with the environment to influence development and health. The first course (BB H 501) presents the theoretical framework of humans as complex dynamic systems, followed by modules on processes of cell biology and genetics as complex systems. This course (BB H 503) continues with modules of the processes of neurobiology, endocrinology, immunology, and pharmacology followed by a section on integrative biology and health. The modules of biological processes are developed from the perspective of how the physiological aspects of the area of biology are relevant to behavioral development and what aspect of this area of biology is linked to behavior. Similar integration with a primary emphasis on behavioral processes is offered in other courses that form the core graduate curriculum. These processes are considered in the context of their role in the comprehensive theoretical models developed in the first section of the two-course sequence. Evaluation of each of the five modules will be by written exam. This required course in the biobehavioral health sequence is designed to provide a multidisciplinary framework of theory and knowledge of biobehavioral processes and their implications for health and illness on which other biobehavioral health courses can build. It is the second of a two-course sequence (BB H 501 and BB H 503). This course will be required by all graduate majors in Biobehavioral Health. It will be available to students in other doctoral programs. It could be a part of a Biobehavioral Health minor for other students.

Students will become familiar with the most prominent theoretical ideas about child development. The latest research on prenatal development, infancy, early and middle childhood will inform the discussions, and students will become familiar with key studies. The major domains of children\'s functioning covered include social interactions and emotional development, cognitive changes and acquisition of language, physiological growth in infancy and biological changes that underlie the transition out of childhood into adolescence. A key feature of this course is how processes in these different domains interact to influence children\'s overall adaptation. Finally, informed by a life course developmental framework, this course will place these developmental processes in context. Students will become familiar with the theoretical and empirical literature that locates children\'s growth and development in the context of families and family change, peer groups, neighborhoods and communities, and the larger cultural context within which they are embedded.

In this course, students gain a thorough hands-on understanding of a wide variety of statistical model types as special cases of the General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with latent variables. Specific statistical model types covered include: exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis; linear, nonlinear and multivariate latent growth curve modeling; quasi-simplex modeling; longitudinal factor modeling; multi-group factor analysis, including a concise introduction to behavior genetic modeling; mediation analysis; testing for measurement equivalence; MANCOVA with nonstandard within-subject covariance structures; outlines of statistical selection theory and principal component analysis. The presentation of these diverse model types as special instances of the same GLMM is helpful to understanding their relationships and differences and considerably streamlines applied statistical modeling. Each of these statistical model types are commonly used to analyze data from studies in the field of Human Development and Family Studies and illustrative examples are provided. Each model type is explained at 4 levels: 1) in terms of a set of simultaneous model equations; 2) as a set of matrix equations; 3) as a graphical model; and 4) as a Lisrel input code. All model assumptions are made explicit and the interrelationships between the 4 levels of model representation are emphasized. Then the model is applied to simulated and real data. The obtained model fits are assessed in terms of various statistical criteria and conclusions are explicitly drawn based on standard statistical decision theory. Selected models from studies of Human Development and other social sciences are interpreted in terms of content and possible pitfalls in their interpretation are discussed.

This course also provides the knowledge base and experience the student needs to evaluate their continued safe participation in rock climbing. Students will be involved from the onset of the course practicing responsibility, cooperation, and collaborative skills. Group work is an essential component to the success of the student and the course as students work together in teams of climber and belayer (method of securing a climber by the use of a rope). This group connection will also develop communication and trust between climber and belayer. Group work provides the climber with feedback and positive encouragement during the climbs. Observing team member(s) learn and practice constructive encouragement and visual observation in evaluating technique and route choice. Also, immediate instructor and peer assessment will be valuable tools in assisting the climber as they practice to achieve a higher proficiency in climbing techniques. One other vital component to be learned and tested is the proficiency of belaying which instills the important responsibility of safe climbing for all. Each class can begin with a physical preparation for climbing focusing on cardiovascular, strength, and flexibility movements with instruction on proper methods and training procedures. Important information on safety issues and equipment will be presented as a visual demonstration or as an individual assignment. Students have the opportunity to write journals to record goals, share what they have learned in the lessons, and evaluate their progress in the class. Other activities may include internet evaluations of rock climbing web sites and interactive sites. Additional evaluation tools may include objective testing, skill proficiency, and safety knowledge. As a final activity, students can participate in a fun team competition that focuses on group work, problem solving, decision making, and cooperation that challenges the skills practiced in this course. The class will be taught every fall and spring semesters with a suggested enrollment of up to 35 students. An indoor climbing facility or wall will be used.</p>"},

Specific course content emphasizes a number of learning outcomes. The first objectives are related to clarifying the nature of the philosophy of physical activity and relationships between the philosophy and science of human movement. The field of philosophy is described including the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology, ethics and aesthetics. A variety of philosophic methodologies are identified and practiced including inductive, deductive and descriptive reasoning. Emphasis is placed on the varying degrees of confidence placed on the trustworthiness of philosophic methods and the validity of its conclusions. Students take a &quot;philosophic readiness inventory&quot; to determine their own philosophic tendencies and interests. Once the philosophy of physical activity is better understood, its methods and products are compared to the methods and outcomes of science. The course emphasizes a potential complementary relationship between the two where neither one is sufficient. A major portion of the class is devoted to three rival interpretations of personhood that have significant implications for professional practice. Students review the strengths and weaknesses of dualism, materialism, and holism and see their impact on biomedical ethics, motivational strategies, professional-client relationships, and other facets of health and physical activity professions. The undergirding logic here is that practitioners must first understand what a person is before they can best determine how to intervene or otherwise provide services to them. Attention is also directed to the subject matter of Kinesiology-namely, skilled movement in general and physical abilities in work, exercise, sport, dance, games, and play more specifically. The nature and values of these different ways of moving are analyzed in terms of their ability to serve as &quot;tools&quot; (means to other ends) and &quot;jewels&quot; (ends in themselves). Issues of motivation, efficacy, safety, and other factors are analyzed in an attempt to determine whether a play-and-enjoyment or a work-and-duty philosophy should be emphasized in various professional settings.

The curriculum is designed to bring a higher percentage of students into a movement subcultures higher percentage than can be achieved in the shorter, instructor-directed, and more traditional educational setting. In order to achieve this in-depth experience, students will be required to take two masters courses (1.5 credit each) in the same activity. Sequential enrollment provisions will be needed, with a maximum of 3 credits counting toward General Education requirements. Each student will meet with the master instructor at the start of a semester to review a menu of activity opportunities (see outline above) in a specific movement domain. Students, in consultation with the instructor, will select a cluster of learning experiences to be encountered that semester. Each menu item chosen will be recorded on the contract along with the method or methods by which that item will be documented in the student\'s portfolio. The agreed upon documentation must be provided before credit is awarded. A completed contract will be signed by both the student and the master teacher. Regular communication between each student and instructor, consistent with the nature of the contract and the activities selected from the menu, will be assured.

Class topics include introductions to the philosophy of science, including the nature of theories, hypotheses, concepts and constructs, to measurement theory, to applied sampling techniques, and to methods of scale construction. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are addressed. In-class activities include the conceptualization and execution of an applied evaluation project. This project involves practice in interviewing, in-class focus groups, survey questionnaire development, data collection, and data analysis. The course will provide students with a conceptual map of how research is conducted, the resources available to them, the vocabulary of research, and guidance in writing a research report. Additionally, this is a Writing Across the Curriculum class. Students will prepare several short writing projects, some based on interviews or observational studies that they have conducted, as well as a final report based on the evaluation research conducted by the entire class. The course material is divided into units of study with topical areas within each unit sequentially presented to parallel the research process itself. Students are expected to have read assigned materials and to attend class prepared to discuss them. Classes involve lectures, discussions, and in-class activities such as focus groups, survey questionnaire development and presentations of research results. This class is required of all undergraduate majors in Recreation, Park and Tourism Management. RPTM 356 and a 3-credit course in statistics are prerequisites for this course. Students from other majors are welcome in this course, providing they have met the pre-requisites.</p>"},

Popular culture is shaped by the development of new technologies of text, sound and image recording and dissemination. While mass media companies have traditionally served as the primary means by which popular culture is diffused throughout society, emerging technologies enable people to produce and consume their own cultural artifacts as well as redefine mass produced cultural artifacts. As people become more adept in their use of emerging technologies, mass media industries such as film, news, radio and television respond by introducing Internet-based services that deliver both newly designed and repackaged traditional content to consumers. We use four approaches to analyze the intricate relationships between people and industry, emerging technologies and popular culture:1. Production Analysis: Who owns the media? Who creates new media? What technologies are being used to produce new media? how does new media challenge the historical dominance of mass media?2. Textual Analysis: how do specific works of popular culture gain their meaning?3. Audience Analysis: How do different audiences make sense of the same cultural and technological artifacts?4. Historical Analysis: how do current popular culture perspectives on emerging technologies differ from those of the past? What accounts for these changing perspectives? Through individual and team-based learning activities, students will analyze and interact with cultural artifacts across popular culture genres. The course content and the assignments are directed at helping students to both create and critique cultural artifacts in ways that demonstrate their understanding of, engagement with, and reflections upon the relationships among people and industry, emerging technology, popular culture. Assessment is based on students\' ability to clearly and convincingly articulate their analysis through classroom discussions, individual activities, and team-based projects. Students will gain hands-on experience with social media such as wikis, virtual worlds, and podcasts. Students will also design and produce short films that demonstrate their ability to integrate and synthesize central themes from the course. Grading will be based on individual and team components.

For example, the inventor rarely has insights into the markets for his/her invention, is often not interested in the details of commercialization, and can be secretive. In addition, the business and financial communities often do not take the time, or have the resources, to understand new technologies and perform complex due diligence. Thus lack of due diligence often leads to rejection of innovation because existing companies often discount new technologies from outside the company as NIH - &amp;quot;not invented here&amp;quot;.Effective transfer of new invention or innovation to a commercial product requires at least three different functional communities to interface: technical, legal and business.

In these teams, students bring the skills and knowledge from their major to develop an invention commercialization recommendation for the Technology Transfer Office and the inventor. For example, business students focus on finance and market opportunity assessment; engineering and IST students focus on design refinements, prototyping support, and (if appropriate) making technology suggestions to the inventor.Upon completing the course, the students will have a working knowledge of different university and corporate technology or invention commercialization processes, important intellectual property management tools for inventions (patents, license agreements, option agreements) source of funding to move inventions toward product development, and delivering top quality presentations which outline the recommended commercialization path. Students who enjoy open-ended projects which involve the interplay of business and invention of who wants to work on interdisciplinary teams with the newest inventions will find this course a valuable course. NOTE: Because the inventions/products are based on Penn State faculty intellectual property, students must sign the Penn State Special Intellectual Property Agreement For Students - For Use When Assigning Intellectual Property to The Pennsylvania State University. The form can be viewed at http://guru.psu.edu/policies/RAG13.htmlThe course will be offered both Spring and Fall semesters with an enrollment of 40 students.</p>"},

Professional security protection could satisfy reasonable assurance criteria by managing legal and regulatory risks based on commonly-held understandings of burglary, theft, conversion and widely-understood but related institutional constraints in the protection of physical property. This focus retained effectiveness so long as physical security over tangible property appeared successful, even extending to the maintenance of control over mainframe computers and their peripherals. However, the proliferation of networked computers has made access and storage ubiquitous, vastly increasing the vulnerability of confidential data, private information and critical national security infrastructure. Security and privacy regulation compliance responsibility now falls much more harshly on both organizations and most of their individual personnel. These complex new duties constrain organizations in the data management industry as well as suppliers and users of data and all participants in the information supply chain, including consultants, software suppliers, applications service providers, maintenance, outsourcing and communications providers.Other factors exacerbate these liability risk management difficulties. Advances in network computer storage and use, the broadening perception of heightened value of information and the pervasive availability of rich data warehousing increase the vulnerability of data management. Risks of information theft and integrity losses as well as the explosion of privacy rights and national security concerns now require pervasive and fuller understanding of liability risk management principles/techniques among all managers and subordinates in the data management industry and in government. Information suppliers, handlers, owners and network service providers are increasingly exposed to civil litigation, regulatory oversight/compliance and criminal prosecution for various information-related wrongs. For example, confidentiality is compulsory for corporate trade secrets, privacy is required for personally identifiable information about individuals and secrecy is mandatory over matters of national security; all of which create complex legal duties that are fundamentally driving the design of information handling processes.

As such this course is an introduction to the topic with special focus on the major theories explaining criminal behavior including differential association, anomie, control theory and labeling theory. A key focus of the class is examining the most recent scientific research testing the basic theories. The students learn the various research techniques that have been used to study criminal behavior including crime statistics such as the Uniform Crime Report that serves as a monitor on crime trends. Several important areas of study that link understanding criminal behavior and its distribution across the social system are investigated including age, gender, race and ethnicity. One goal of the course is to promote a more complete understanding of crime and how it is enmeshed in human social life. The course concludes by using the knowledge base generated in the course to study the link of our understanding of criminal behavior and the emerging crime control policies of the past few decades. Finally, the course reviews the impact and effectiveness of some of these policies. Throughout the course, the lectures as well as the readings emphasize the complexity of explaining human behavior and criminal behavior in particular. One aspect of the course is the use of a term paper on the objective and subjective availability of crime to the student. This paper emphasizes the complexity of the student\'s social life and the role that these factors may have on whether they have engaged in criminal behavior and their analysis of the causes of their criminal behavior. This project personalizes the various theories and helps the student understand the importance of their social environment in whether they have or will engage in crime.

First, the course studies the jurisdictions of the various courts and their organization in various state systems as well as the federal courts as well as the organization of state and federal administrative offices that manage the courts including the training of judges and the preparation of the court budget. Subsequent to the development of the basic understanding of the court jurisdiction and organization, the class studies the roles of the key actors in the day-in and day-out operation of the courts. In the spotlight are judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys although the role of the probation officers and clerk of courts are also intertwined with the processing of defendants. Of particular importance in this component of the course is the development of what is referred to as the court community and the focal concerns and goals that the court must consider as it processes cases. An, understanding of court community and focal concerns serves as crucial context for understanding the role of public policy as it attempts to shift or change the decision making of the court. One important dynamic of this course is the understanding that the court, although functioning as an institution to provide a neutral field on which accusations of criminality are to be played out, operates similarly to other organizations in that they are to be efficient (move cases with minimum overhead) and to be effective (provide justice, and protect the public). How the courts balance these competing demands and the informal processes that emerge in the processing of defendants is the key focus of the class. Finally, the course explores the attempts to reform the courts from the sentencing reforms such as determinate sentencing, mandatory minimums including &amp;quot;3 strikes&amp;quot; and sentencing guidelines. These issues highlight the political context of the courts and adaptability of the courts to attempts to change their values, and decisions. This course serves as one core 400-level course in the major. Each student must take two of the five core 400-level courses.</p>"},

We focus primarily on regions north of the equator, although there is a brief segment on South Africa mining. Specific topics include the Nile River (sources of the Nile, agricultural practices, effects of damming the Nile, hydropolitics), the Sahara and Sahel (salt mines, climate change, drought, water resources), and natural resources and their role in politics (gold, diamonds, oil, and gas). The theme of climate change cuts across the entire semester. The quantitative and analytical components of the course involve working through a combination of map exercises and data manipulations (flood stage, groundwater age, rainfall and temperature records). Writing exercises are conducted both individually (essays, analysis of readings) and in collaborative teams (climate change analysis). Readings for the course come from the popular scientific literature; current refereed research journals, and transcribed oral histories of African people. Faculty lectures will comprise ~30% of the course, and student presentations ~20%, with the remainder of the time devoted to in-class collaborative exercises. There are no pre-requisites for this course. It will be offered annually with a maximum enrollment of 100 students.The goals of the course are to (1) introduce the scientific study of Africa; (2) develop quantitative and scientific reasoning skills; (3) explore the relationship between human society and the natural world. The topics that we explore (e.g., global climate change, allocation of limited water resources) are important political issues that affect people in developed and developing countries throughout the world. It is crucial that the next generation of citizens be informed as to how scientific data is obtained, presented, and interpreted by scientists as well as politicians. Students will work individually and (more commonly) in teams to analyze real data from natural African systems, and will then report their findings to the class both orally and in writing. Examples of the data sets include 100-year records of monthly rainfall and temperature from stations throughout the continent, fossil suites from ancient lake cores in the modern Sahara, and historical writings of Nile flood levels from pre-Biblical times. Through these exercises students will gain an appreciation of the scope of geological time and change, and will be able to incorporate this new long-term perspective into identification and resolution of modern quesitons.</p>"},

The course is an introduction to the history of Africa south of the Sahara from the origins of humankind to roughly 1750. Since it is not possible to undertake a systematic survey of the period -- the continent is too vast and our data too sparse -- we will focus on a number of common themes in the cultural and historical development of African societies. We will start with an introduction to African cultures and the problems in studying them, move on to examine the evidence for the early origins of humans on the African continent, the agricultural revolution, and ancient African kingdoms, empires and civilizations (including Egypt). We will then explore three interrelated themes in the history of Africa from the 16th-18th centuries: trade, state formation, and the spread of Islam. Finally, we will turn to an examination of the slave trade and its impact on Africa and the Americas. This is also a course in historical reconstruction and analysis. There are few documentary sources for this period and much of the data we have is fragmentary. The resulting history consists largely of long-term social changes rather than detailed narrative. We must thus learn to reconstruct history from what evidence is available, using general principles of African social, economic, and political organization that we will develop in class.

Specifically, it will analyze the extent to which the processes of state building, nation building, and international intervention have contributed to the incidence of both civil war and international conflict in Africa. We will begin with a review of several theoretical arguments on the causes of warfare in Africa and then turn to a discussion of theses on African political development. This course complements present offerings in international relations and comparative politics in the PLSC department and can serve as an advanced undergraduate offering in the African Studies concentration in AFR. The course directly complements our present offerings in international conflict given that we don\';t have a regularly offered course that focuses on conflict in a specific region. In addition, it will augment our comparative politics offerings with an examination of prominent issues in comparative politics such as political development, democracy, and modernization. The course will fulfill the IL requirement and encourage students understanding of the historical background as well as the political, economic, and cultural factors that influence African politics. African conflicts are often viewed as &quot;ethnic conflicts&quot; and in this class students have an opportunity to assess the extent to which ethnic, linguistic, or religious factors influence the likelihood of conflict and contribute to development in African states. Students will also be required to write essays evaluating the contribution of a range of theoretical arguments on Africa\';s conflicts in order to assess the degree to which cultural more than political or economic factors contribute to their onset. Students will then have the opportunity to conduct more extensive research on a specific African case to develop their analyses further. These exercises will often require that students reevaluate their beliefs about social identities such as race (e.g. in Rwanda the difference between Tutsi and Hutu is often viewed as a &quot;racial&quot; difference between black Africans, which is at odds with most Western conceptions of race). They also require students to challenge stereotypes regarding the subordination of African values in conflicts to a simple concern with &quot;tribe&quot;. Students will gain a broader knowledge and appreciation of the different values, traditions, and cultures evident in Africa and understand how these can both exacerbate and mitigate conflict. Evaluation in the course will consist largely of examination of the students\' brief expository essays and larger case studies for which students will be encouraged to conduct original research. The course should be offered biannually with a class limit of about 40 students.</p>"},

The cereal grains these early societies relied upon, such as rice, wheat, and barley, soon formed the basis for the first alcoholic beverages. Relying on ethnographic, biological, linguistic, and archaeological data, the course will introduce students to what we now know about how humans created and currently use fermented beverages across cultures. The course introduces students to the basic concepts of anthropology by highlighting the variability of alcohol use through time and space.

Through comparisons between humans and other mammals, particularly the living nonhuman primates, this course provides an essential comparative zoological perspective with which we can understand the origins, evolution, and diversity of our species. The course is structured around the theory of evolution, the unifying concept of biological anthropology. Throughout the course, students will be introduced to evolutionary theory as well as to the mechanisms of evolution and their relevance for understanding variation in past and present human populations. The course covers current research and topics in human evolutionary biology including evolutionary theory, natural selection, molecular and population genetics, human variation, human biology, primate diversity and behavior, and the paleontological record of human evolution. This course not only introduces students to the core concepts within the field of Biological Anthropology, but also provides a rich foundation for understanding the human condition from a biological and anthropological perspective. By the end of the course, students will be able to 1) explain the theory of evolution and the mechanisms underlying this process; 2) discuss human variation and human biology within the context of primate diversity and adaptations; 3) describe the major behavioral and morphological trends over the course of human evolutionary history and how they relate to modern human diversity. <a href="/search/?P=ANTH%2021" title="ANTH&#160;21" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, \'ANTH 21\');">ANTH&#160;21</a> is one of three core courses required of majors and minors in the Department of Anthropology and can also be used to fulfill three credits of General Education in the Natural Sciences.

It aims to expand our understanding of Jewish communities by focusing on those that are, alternatively, small, situated in out-of-the-way places, culturally outside the Jewish urban mainstream, or embedded in a larger society with markedly different values and traditions. These communities often constitute the points-of-contact between Jews and non-Jews, and in so doing sometimes transform Jews, non-Jews, and the relationships among them. Other such communities constitute experiments in Jewish lifeways and provide mainstream Jews with pilot projects for potential social and cultural change. This course will explore the significance of small, little-known, idiosyncratic, and anomalous Jewish communities on Jewish history and culture, and draw on them to instruct students on the social and cultural processes of small or unusual communities generally. The communities studied will be located both in the U.S. and elsewhere in which Jews have lived as a minority community during modern times. The course will look at the founding, growth, and decline of such communities and at their social processes and institutions. It will explore how to understand and analyze such communities, which vary from one part of the world to another.

These incorporate a wide range of topics with an emphasis on how human social behavior and resource use are integrated into ecological processes and their services at multiple scales. In so doing, the course takes a holistic perspective of the human experience; one that views cultural, biological, environmental, demographic, and technological processes as interconnected phenomena, and human behavior and practices as components of complex adaptive systems. The topics covered are especially timely in our contemporary political and environmental context, and will explore the relevance of human ecology for these on-going debates.</p>"},

ANTH (SOC) 579 Spatial Demography (3)The improved application of spatial data and methods to demographic research is a critical methodological challenge facing demographers today. This graduate seminar is designed to focus on substantive demographic research topics while exposing sociologists and demographers to challenges in, and opportunities for, using geographic information systems (GIS), spatial analysis, and spatial statistics in their own research. Substantive foci will include readings and discussions of spatial perspectives on topics such as racial/ethnic segregation, spatial mismatch/entrapment, poverty, crime/delinquency, migration, health inequalities, wellbeing, maternal and child health, environmental justice, and population and environment relations. Similarly, the seminar will highlight connections between spatial concepts and data availability (e.g., Modifiable Areal Unit Problem - MAUP; data privacy), other emerging methodological approaches to studying society (e.g., contextual modeling, multi-level modeling and the area of neighborhood effects) as well as the integration of different types of data (e.g. qualitative data and quantitative data). Throughout the course lectures and discussions will be complemented with lab sessions introducing spatial analysis methods and GIS and spatial analysis software. The lab sessions will include the use of among other software GeoDa, CrimeStat, R, and ArcGIS (including Geostatistical Analyst and Spatial Analyst extensions). These lab sessions will introduce many methodological and technical issues relevant to spatial analysis (e.g., error, data validation, data integration, cartography, exploratory spatial data analysis, spatial regression modeling, geographically weighted regression, point pattern analysis and geostatistics). Assignments for the courses include up to two writing assignments, up to four lab assignments, and a final project which will be presented as a short 15-minute presentation as well as submitted as a term paper. The writing assignments will include an annotated bibliography/brief literature review within a selected demographic theme area and a profile of a well-known demographer and their adoption of spatial thinking/perspectives/methods. The lab assignments will focus on building geospatial databases, basic spatial analysis, exploratory spatial data analysis, and spatial regression modeling. The courses will include other labs and assignements that will be completed for no grade; these are inteded as mechanisms/opportunities for developing and enhancing familiarity with selected software, data resources, and analytic methods.</p>"},

{"course_code": "ANTH 8", "course_credits": "3 Credits", "course_title": "Aztec, Inca, Maya", "course_desc": "<p>ANTH 8 is a comparative survey of the development of the pre-Columbian Latin American civilizations. It is a general survey of three of the great complex societies of the New World - the Aztec and the Maya of Mesoamerica (Southern Mexico and Northern Central America), and the Inca of the Central Andes of South America. Both the Aztec and the Inca empires were thriving in the 16th century when Europeans arrived, and are known almost completely from ethnographic information such as oral and written records. The Classic Maya were much earlier (AD 250-900), and are known primarily through archaeological research, but also through the lens of the New World\'s only sophisticated writing system. The course informs students about the methods of archaeology and places these cultures in a broader comparative perspective. By studying archaeological evidence from several sites we will address a few important theoretical issues in archaeology. These issues include: 1) the relationship between people, the environment, and social organization 2) the study of elites and commoners in archaeological cultures, and 3) the use of historical and archaeological data in reconstructing the past. Throughout the semester we will also examine varied lines of evidence, including archaeological artifacts, human remains, architecture, murals, sculpture, and historical texts (esp. codices and colonial accounts) to assess the role of evidence and theory in how we conceptualize the past. The information presented emphasizes the nature of these societies, analysis and interpretation of their basic institutions, religions, world views, as well as their culture histories. Central to the presentation is the degree to which modern Latin American cultures and populations have deep cultural and biological roots in the Pre-Columbian past, and many ethnographic models are discussed. Within the context of each segment, sociological concepts such as institutions, households, stratification, political economy, urbanization, and a host of others are used as organizing features. Issues of gender, ethnicity, and class structure are also discussed. Issues such as the peopling of the Americas, the origins of agriculture, and other Mesoamerican cultures are also reviewed.</p>"},

The prehistoric origins of warfare is a hotly debated topic and constitutes the starting point for this course. Most scholars are agreed that military culture grew in step with sociopolitical development over the course of the third millennium BCE. In the following centuries, the Egyptians, and later the Assyrians and Persians, took great strides in developing sophisticated tactical systems, using infantry, chariotry, and cavalry. These matters occupy a little over the first third of the course. Across the Aegean Sea, Bronze Age (Mycenaean) Greece was ruled by elites occupying massively walled citadels, their leaders buried surrounded by their weapons. But how did these warriors fight? Do the epic poems of Homer memorialize Bronze Age combat? In the Archaic Period (700-500 BCE) infantry warfare in Greece was transformed by the appearance of the heavily-armored infantryman (the hoplite), deployed in a tight formation (the phalanx). The processes involved in the appearance of this kind of warfare, its nature, and its affects on Greek society and culture will be the focus of our attention for the second third of the course. On the periphery of the Mediterranean basin stood a variety of warrior cultures (the Scythians, Celts, or Germans). Numerous warrior-dominated polities vied with each other in Archaic Italy, but one of them, sitting on a ford on the river Tiber, ultimately rose to be the greatest military power produced by the ancient Mediterranean world &amp;ndash; Rome. The Roman legions first won and then ensured the security of a Mediterranean-wide empire that stood for 700 years and evolved ultimately into world&amp;rsquo;s first standing army of professional volunteers. The Roman military system holds our attention for the final third of the course. The course defines &amp;ldquo;warfare&amp;rdquo; broadly to include both tactical and strategic, as well as cultural and ideological, matters. Even this canvas is too vast to be surveyed in all its richness, so the major themes explored are: (i) what is war, where does it come from, and how did it change as civilization spread?; (ii) in what ways did warfare develop in the periods under study, in terms of strategy, tactics, and weapons technology?; (iii) how do different warfare practices reflect essential facets of the various cultures under consideration?</p>"},

CAMS 033 CAMS 033 Roman Civilization (3)( GH;IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Roman Civilization (CAMS 033) provides a comprehensive survey of one of the major and most interesting societies from which contemporary western culture developed. For over 1200 years, the Romans expanded and ruled over the largest empire in recorded history. An understanding of their successes and failures can inform our own understanding of modern politics and international relationships. Many ideas in such diverse areas as government, law, military organization and strategy, the calendar, social practices, urban life, literature, art, and architecture clearly derive from Roman practices. Knowledge of the Romans, and the similarities and important differences between their lives and ours provides an opportunity to reflect on human values and contemporary culture.The course includes discussion of the origins of the Romans, how they saw it themselves, and the rather different picture painted by modern archaeology. How the Romans expanded and maintained their power with long periods of peace from what is now Great Britain to the borders of India, and how their power waned in the later Roman period is one of the great illustrations of political institutional design. Roman society included various social groups, from slaves to the wealthy members of the traditional nobility. The opportunity for movement from slave to freedman or freedwoman to landowner helps explain why for generations Roman rule was widely accepted. Roman urban life, with its great public meeting halls, baths, arenas, race courses, and luxurious houses and comfortable apartment blocks was eagerly accepted across Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. Many of these areas were more intensively and successfully populated under the Romans than at any time since. The greatest achievements of Rome\'s poets, Virgil\'s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and Ovid\'s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; remain rich sources for current writers, composers, and choreographers. Major Roman historians and thinkers also continue to inform and inspire. Religious beliefs and the causes for the growth of Christianity are also important features of the Roman Empire. Almost two thousand years separate us from the summit of Roman power and yet we still benefit from a study of their society to understand our own.The class meetings include twice weekly lectures for all students enrolled and once a week discussion sections of thirty students or less. Small enrollment classes meeting three times each week may also be scheduled. Assignments include individual and group papers, tests, and a final examination. Students are expected to participate actively in class discussions.In addition to twice weekly lectures for the 200 students in this course, smaller discussion sections of 30 students or less are scheduled once per week. All students will be expected to participate actively in the class discussions. In addition, students will write one individual paper and a longer paper based on collaborative work. In preparation of the written papers, students will gather information from both computer/electronic resources and use of the library. WEB resources for the study of classical antiquities and ancient texts are extremely rich. By integrating these various sources, students will be expected to synthesize various sources and to analyze the relationships between ancient and modern culture. A major assignment in this course requires collaborative learning and the preparation of a written paper in groups of 4 students. Study of the Romans includes learning in detail about the geography, resources, and cultures of a very large area of the world from southern Scotland to North Africa, and from Gibraltar to the borders of India. Many basic features of these areas remain relatively unchanged, and the realities of the resources and climate continue to regulate modern societies who inhabit the same spaces, often less successfully.</p>"},

CAMS 044 CAMS (RL ST) 044 Ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian Mythology (3) (GH;IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course introduces students to a selection of major ancient Mediterranean and Egyptian myths, gods, and goddesses. Ancient Canaan, Mesopotamia, and Egypt (geographically approximating the contemporary Middle East) were primary locations for the development-beginning already in the fourth millennium B.C.E.-of highly complex urban civilizations, many of which persisted until the turn of the Era. These ancient societies were responsible for notable technological achievements, such as writing, sophisticated irrigation systems, and the wheel, and for notable cultural achievements, such as impressive legal codes, highly developed astronomical research, and complex religious systems. This course will acquaint students with some major religious writings stemming from these fascinating old world cultures. The class discusses in some detail a limited range of stories about the divine realm, creation, the flood, kingship, life and death, and sexuality. The course pursues such comparisons by studying myths against the background of the different cultures that produce them. Because a number of these religious myths are historically related, the course will also critically compare the similarities and the differences between them. To underscore how important historical and geographic settings are to understanding these stories, the course uses different techniques of instruction such as small group discussions, slides, lectures, and films.Three of the world\'s major religions-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-trace their roots to the religions of the ancient Near East and Egypt. Hence, some attention will be paid to the similarities and differences between the views expressed in these myths and the views developed in classical Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. By grappling with issues such as divine character, self-identity, and female/male relationships in the ancient Mediterranean world, students will be better acquainted with how classical Judaism, Christianity, and Islam innovate beyond the religious heritage to which they are indebted.</p>"},

First encountered in caption texts and snippets of conversation of the workers and peasants in late Old Kingdom mastaba depictions, Middle Egyptian originally was the vernacular of the &amp;quot;street&amp;quot; during the outgoing Old Kingdom. In the upheaval that swept away the monarchy and elite of the Old Kingdom the language which characterized the Pharaonic court (Old Egyptian) was swept away as well. In the subsequent First Intermediate Period, the language that everyone speaks is a lower class register. Middle Egyptian was given a fillip shortly after the turn of the millennium when the new regime of the 12th Dynasty (c. 1991-1786 BC) established a writing school and adopted this dialect as the accepted literary medium. The scribes of this institution produced a number of literary pieces, hymns and poetry which although created in writing, were intended for oral dissemination parlando. They rapidly became classics and were copied and learned by heart for centuries into the future. Middle Egyptian was used in every walk of life from monumental inscriptions, religious, and mortuary texts to letters, business documents and accounts, and the output from Dyn. 12 through 18 was prodigious. Even beyond the 14th Century BC learned scribes would continue to make the attempt at composing in Middle Egyptian, even though the language was no longer spoken, and as a quasi-ecclesiastical speech it continued down to Greco-Roman times. By that time its restriction to temple texts gave the false impression that both language and script had always had the purpose of conveying religious concepts, hence the Greek misnomer \'hieroglyphs\', i.e. holy script.</p>"},

Equally important, students are introduced to the principles of Latin style by learning how to translate English into Latin. The review of Latin grammar and the introduction to Latin prose composition provide students with the competence to read representative Roman authors in poetry and prose. Rudimentary Latin readings, supported by school commentaries, are intended to familiarize students with famous examples of classical Roman literature while exemplifying the principles of classical Latin style. For the Republican period, students read selections of Caesar\'s Gallic Wars or a speech by Cicero and selections of Catullus\'s love poetry. For the Imperial period, one investigates different accounts of the rape of Lucretia by Livy and Ovid, in poetry and prose, respectively. These readings not only show how exemplary authors write in different styles, but how Latin language and literature lay the linguistic and cultural foundations of western civilization.

While existing seminars focus on comparative studies organized according to concepts such as literary theory, period, theme, or genre, through the proposed new seminars the Department of Comparative Literature seeks to provide visibility for the full complement of courses that reflect the department\'s global perspective. These proposals also respond to the College\'s policy to avoid repeated use of the 597 number for similar subject-matter. Thus we are proposing three separate comparative courses on Asian, African, and Inter-American literatures. All represent subject-matter previously taught as <a href="/search/?P=CMLIT%20597" title="CMLIT&#160;597" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, \'CMLIT 597\');">CMLIT&#160;597</a> or other less clearly defined CMLIT numbers.Comparative study of African literatures is an increasingly important part of the curriculum of our Comparative Literature Department. It is a field of study identified as one of our specialties in our recent strategic plans. Joining existing graduate seminars in European literatures, this course and the other two new graduate courses now being proposed (on Asian and Inter-American literatures) will make visible the ways in which the departmental curriculum covers the diverse geographical areas relevant to comparative literary study.Our Department offers language instruction in Swahili and Arabic, has long taught 100-level and 400-level courses on African literature, has developed linkages with several African universities, and has attracted a steady stream of graduate students to work in African literature during the last two decades. Interest in the literatures of Africa is strong.Africa as a continent has produced thousands of writers and a highly diverse body of literature written in English, French, Arabic, Portuguese and over 50 African languages. It is also a rich source of literature recorded from oral traditions maintained in the more than 1,000 languages spoken on the continent. A comparative approach to the study of these literatures provides an appropriately internationalized context for understanding African literatures and for seeing them in the purview of world literature as a whole.In sum, we have long had separate numbers for our undergraduate African languages and literature courses and we have previously offered graduate courses on African literatures under general numbers. In addition to complying with College policy and not continuing to use 597 repeatedly, we wish to make this field more visible within our curriculum by giving it a course number of its own.</p>"},

Major components of the course are constrained maximization, the theory of the consumer, the theory of the producer, general equilibrium, market structures, and game theory. The goal of this course is to give the student the fundamentals of microeconomics that will be applied widely to upper level courses in economics. The course begins by developing a model of consumer behavior. This model is extended to derive a consumer\xc2\xbfs demand for a good, and then numerous applications of this model are investigated, including income and substitution effects of a price change, as well as the determination of relative prices in a general equilibrium framework. The supply side of the market is then discussed. The theory of the firm is developed, and students will explore firm behavior and welfare analysis in various market settings including perfectly competitive markets, monopoly, and oligopoly with strategic interaction between firms. Economics is an analytical subject. Students will learn to use inductive reasoning and other scientific methodology necessary to understand this and other (social) sciences.

A two-period consumption model is also analyzed with the life cycle theory of consumption. Economic models are studied to analyze these topics, and macroeconomic goals for a society are discussed. After acquiring many analysis tools, the course discusses general equilibrium, where formal theories can model a variety of shocks that hit the macroeconomy and the corresponding reactions in a variety of markets. Related topics include the production function, marginal productivity of capital, firm investment, labor demand, labor supply, marginal product of labor, the supply side of the economy, and aggregate demand. After establishing a solid understanding of general equilibrium, students will examine the Federal Reserve, monetary policy, the market for reserves, open market operations, and quantitative easing. The course finishes with lessons comparing and contrasting classical economic theory vs. Keynesian economic theory. The strengths and weaknesses of each theory are considered relative to the business cycle data.</p>"},

This course includes topics that examine the economics of mergers as well as economic policy with regard to mergers. There often are both pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects of mergers. In the U.S. the Federal Trade Commission has primary responsibility for assessing the balance between effects. Along with the FTC, the antitrust division of the department of justice can analyze potential mergers using economic data and forecasts with tools such as the HHI and four-firm concentration ratio. Legality of non-competitive markets and mergers is also analyzed using the Clayton and Sherman antitrust acts. Topics discussed related to pro-merger economic effects include reduction in the duplication of costly capital, economies of scale, reducing costs by cutting management, human resources, payroll, and other jobs not directly related to production of output. Further, some firms may contend that they are non-viable as a small business, but can survive as a larger competitor as the result of a merger. Finally, mergers may have positive implications for shareholders who effectively own the company. Negative effects of mergers topics are discussed, including a reduction in the number of competing firms, increase in market power, higher prices, reduction in consumer choice, and increased lobbying power of larger firms. This course examines unilateral effects and coordinated effects as identified in the horizontal merger guidelines. Vertical mergers are analyzed as well, where multiple parts of the production process of a final good come under the same ownership. Econometric issues associated with the measurement of unilateral and coordinated effects are discussed. The course concludes with ex-post merger reviews. This course is an applied microeconomics seminar in the field of industrial organization and will seek to provide students with the analytical methods of both the theoretical and empirical analysis of mergers. The course will count toward both the major and the minor in economics.</p>"},

Examples for discussion could be drawn from the work of such writers as Henry Beston Rachel Carson, and Jan DeBlieu. The general concerns of the course then move to environmental ethics, specifically as ethical questions are embodied in literature\'s representation of the human relationship with the other-than-human world. General ethical questions then lead to specific treatments of human and wild animal interaction by various writers. The point is to explore how writers represent the optimal sort of relationship humans can have with the wild world, and what such representation might mean to the ways we personally interact with nature.From these opening considerations, the course turns to an examination of the way in which writers who focus on a specific region of the coast--South Atlantic barrier islands, for example-- establish a sense of the place in their writing. The course would then narrow its focus even more, moving from a consideration of a regional cultural identity to that of specific towns or narrowly defined areas within the general region. The subject of the narrower focus should then be explored in specific detail, beginning with pre-European cultures, the first explorers and settlers and then moving on to other aspects of the American culture history that make the subject area distinctive. For example, a course on the Low Country of South Carolina might start with the accounts of John Lawson, who published his journal of his own trip up the Santee River in 1701, move to accounts of the rice culture so important to the region in the nineteenth century and to the an examination of the Gullah Geechee culture established by West African slaves on Low Country plantations, and then move to writing from more recent writers, all of which help to define the area\'s distinctive cultural and particularly its literary identity.This course was designed to include an out-of-the-classroom education experience. The enhancement trip should include experiences related to the cultural and natural history of the region. It should provide opportunities to walk in the footsteps of writers whose work is discussed in the classroom. There could be a course fee in addition to tuition for such enhancement experiences.</p>"},

In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Topics under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include a chronological introduction to the development of women\'s literature, a consideration of a principle theme or themes common to women\'s literature through a number of works from across a number of historical periods, a consideration of a number of women\'s works in the context of historical events central to their creation, a consideration of a number of women\'s works in the context of formal or aesthetic elements common to those works and their various effects. Time allofted for the study of the works under consideration will vary. This class will prepare students for advanced courses in women\'s literature as well as other academic courses that engage in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts. Students will be evaluated by means of essays written in and out of class, essay exams, term-long reading journals, and class participation. Students should expect to complete a minimum of three written assignments in the course of the term. The course may be used as English Major elective credit or as credit towards the English Minor and will be offered once a year with 60 seats per offering.</p>"},

It stretches the bounds of literary or narrative journalism by asking the reader to consider it as art, primarily, versus as testimony, fact, or information-delivery. Students taking this course will explore the genre\'s influences in fiction, research, and poetry; critical analyses will complement this exploration, and formal experimentation will prepare students to imagine novel relationships between form and content. Discussing traditional storytelling technique, the course introduces students to story rudiments including the inciting episode, rising and falling action, climax and denouement and the so-called swerve ending. The course also introduces students to the possibilities of the nonlinear &quot;lyric essay&quot; as outlined in Seneca Review and elsewhere, as well as to the &quot;modular&quot; essay; uses of blank space for communicating the unsayable; and how poetic style can circle elusive meaning.In exploring issues of nuance and implied or glanced-at meaning, the course also discusses the place of truth in nonfiction - differing constructions and conceptions of truth; reader expectations for factuality in a work of nonfiction; and the complications of unreliability when the fallibility of memory or a multiplicity of perspectives color testimony.Finally, the course examines the role of nontraditional structure in conveying a postmodern understanding of subjectivity, for instance by looking at the use of multiple voices and personae in the works of certain contemporary authors.

While individual authors and works discussed in class will vary, the course addresses the overall development of literatures in the United States by time periods and genres that may range from pre-Columbian oral traditions to American fiction and poetry published until the end of the Civil War. The class may feature the study of representative examples of both oral traditions and written works. In addition to highlighting enduring literary voices, the class may also highlight the development of specific genres (such as slave narratives), literary movements (such as Transcendentalism), periods of literary production (such as the American Renaissance) or other groupings of authors (such as the Fireside Poets) over the course of US literary history. Likewise, the class may include works both by authors who were popular at the time when they published their works (and thus able to impact American literature and culture during their lifetime) and those whose contributions to literary history were recognized only later. While it should be expected that no version of this course will be able to cover all authors whose works emerged before 1865, selected authors and works might include the following: examples of Native American, African American, and other oral traditions; excerpts from works by authors such as Anne Bradstreet, Edward Taylor, Cotton Mather, Phillis Wheatley, Samson Occom, Benjamin Franklin, Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, Harriet Beecher Stowe, William Cullen Bryant, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendel Holmes, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, or Emily Dickinson.</p>"},
{"course_code": "ENGL 245", "course_credits": "3 Credits", "course_title": "Introduction to LGBTQ Studies", "course_desc": "<p>An introduction to the dominant themes in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies, with an emphasis on both literary &amp; cultural studies. This course explores the history of modern, western ideas about sexual identity as manifested in literature, theater, film, and other narrative forms of popular culture. Drawing on the substantial body of &quot;queer theory&quot; generated by scholars in the humanities since the 1990s, this class examines sexuality not as a &quot;natural&quot; or consistent phenomenon, but as a set of beliefs that have changed over time and manifest themselves differently in different cultural and historical contexts. Starting in the late nineteenth century, scientific and medical authorities began categorizing individuals into sexual types based on their manifestations of gendered characteristics and their erotic attractions and practices. This medical typing corresponded with the development of subcultures associated with deviance from sexual norms; these subcultures produced a rich variety of texts, images, performances, and social forms, many of which became central to both popular and high culture. This course explores this rich archive, moving among media. It investigates constructions of sexual conformity and how sexual nonconformists positioned themselves in relation to cultural and medical group identities. It examines how distinctions between gendered, raced, and classed bodies were historically produced and culturally contested. It considers what commonalities gay identities may - or may not -- share with lesbian identities and how transgender and other identities have altered perceptions of sexual identity. The course also explores the relationship of the avant-garde to the mass media and how sexual subcultures have shaped literary and other cultural forms of expression. Comparative study of issues of sexual mobility beyond and between the borders of the United States expands the course\'s critical scope beyond dominant forms of western culture. This course does not propose definitive answers to the questions of identity it addresses. Instead it negotiates the ways sexualities have enabled individuals to articulate -- and disarticulate -- themselves within social bodies past and present. This course, therefore, has wide relevance for students interested in how group identities come into being and transform over time in dynamic relation to other historical forces. Exploring a wide variety of cultural forms associated with the history of sexual identity as well as a variety of interpretations of that history, this course opens students to an archive of literature, theater, film, and other narrative arts with the potential to inform and enrich their understandings of many kinds of challenges to regimes of normativity today.</p>"},

The course will consider such questions as, Are there ever legitimate grounds for censorship? How do standards of censorship differ between countries? What is the relation between censorship on political and on moral grounds? What does artistic merit have to do with concern about moral or political subversion? Works from England, South Africa and the United States will be read and discussed, and where available, excerpts from trial transcripts will be read in order to examine arguments for and against publication.

Texts will vary from battlefield experiences to repercussions of war to the symbolic implications of war. Questions will be raised about literary authority: Does one need to be combatant to write about war? If not, how does one find the authority to speak, particularly as a woman? How does race and/or ethnicity complicate one\'s perceptions of American participation in war? Readings will include works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Joseph Heller, Cynthia Ozick, Leslie Marmon Silko, Norman Mailer, Bobbie Mason, Tim O\'Brien, and Toni Morrison.Another variation will focus specifically on the writings which emerged from the postwar African-American struggle for civil rights. The course will include not only fiction and poetry but also those speeches, sermons, editorials, and other forms of discourse to have emerged from the era. The emphasis will be both traditional literary concerns as well as on the various rhetorical strategies involved in each work. Ideally, the course would make visible to students the difficulties attendant upon any attempt to separate the concerns of rhetoric and persuasion too firmly from the concerns of literature. The course could conclude with a look at some of the various biographies, autobiographies, and histories written over the last twenty-five years, which attempt to shape our national memory.Other variations include literature as a response to Newtonian science or to Darwinism or to the American Depression or to postwar technology or to new dystopias or to AIDS or, as in the sample outline, the Civil Rights movement.</p>"},

It follows the genre\'s evolution into the twenty-first century, outlining the relationships among the texts that form the body of African American narrative as well as the relationships of those texts to the constantly shifting cultural and political realities surrounding their writing. From the Renaissance heralded by Alain Locke, through the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements -and their attendant Black Arts Movement- and into the era of the Movement for Black Lives, course readings encompass a broad range of styles and genres, from realism, naturalism, and naturalist primitivism, through the experimental forms, magical realism, and &quot;postrace aesthetics&quot; of later times. The course invites students to think critically about the African American novel as a socially and politically engaged form, and to identify and analyze the long tradition of resistance that variously informs its development. Authors covered in the course might include major figures such as Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Ann Petry, James Baldwin, Ishmael Reed, Earnest Gaines, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, Octavia Butler, Gayle Jones, Samuel Delany, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Colson Whitehead, and others. Still, the course gives due attention to lesser known/studied materials from the period, including graphic novels, satire, speculative fiction, performance novels, and various other experimental forms. Course readings and instruction give particular attention to how African American novels of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries variously engage social identity categories, like race, gender, class, and sexuality, and how they engage and resist various literary conventions associated with naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism. The course also traces the development of new thematic and aesthetic interests in a generation of writers whose fiction has been influenced by the explosion of interest in the graphic novel, the popularity of cultural forms such as hip hop, and the ascendancy of the digital age. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American literature. In this course, students learn how to analyze literature, do close and careful readings of texts, conduct related research, and write persuasively about literary works. Assignments and discussions are designed such that students may engage with course figures and materials within their historical milieus.</p>"},

The class can also be taught in relationship to earlier periods, dealing, for instance, with English women novelists from 1775-1865. In such a class, readings would include fiction by Fanny Burney, Mary Wolistonecraft, Ann Radcliffe, Jane Austen, Mary Shelly, Emily Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot. The course would then place each novel in its historical, social, intellectual, and literary context, and explore the various ways in which some of England\'s best writers transformed their female experience of the world into fiction that extended the range and influenced the development of the novel. Regardless of the particular focus, all sections of the course pose the following questions throughout: Do women use the same myths, archetypes, and literary conventions as male writers? Or do they sometimes have to modify the myths, archetypes, and literary conventions originated by their male precursors in order to adapt them to female experience? Is there such a thing as a distinctively female imagination, with a symbolic language of its own? Is there such a thing as a chain of literary influence linking women writers to each other? What are the strategies for coping with the anxieties of authorship? What is the interaction between gender and genre? In what ways are creativity and procreativity modes of defying prevailing ideologies? Does a woman\'s psychological development have an effect on the plots a woman novelist conceives? How does women\'s literature reflect the realities of women\'s lives? As a course in women\'s literature, ENGL/<a href="/search/?P=WMNST%20490" title="WMNST&#160;490" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, \'WMNST 490\');">WMNST&#160;490</a> concerns itself with questions of gender. In so far as some of these women writers are black or women of color, it concerns itself with questions of race and ethnicity. In as far as the course looks at women\'s literature in the context of men\'s literature, it is concerned with the inter-relationship between dominant (male) and non-dominant (female) culture in the United States as well as in Britain. In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Students should expect to complete a minimum of three written assignments in the course, two course papers, and an essay final exam in class. The papers each will ask students to choose a text to analyze in relationship to one of the thematic modules the course has chosen, for instance, to discuss how Virginia Woolf s Mrs. Dalloway analyzes the position of upper-middle class women in a particular moment in history when women had achieved the vote, but were still largely constrained by patriarchal social norms. In addition to written assignments, students will be evaluated on class discussion and general participation. The course not only prepares students for taking up literary and cultural analysis in English classes, but also in any other class that engages in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts, and in other classes in Women\'s Studies or in other Penn State departments that address the social, cultural, or ethical issues of gender. The course may be used as English Major elective credit or as credit towards the English Minor; it may also be used in the Women\'s Studies major and minor.

German 201 is designed to help students further develop the four basic language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) they have attained in previous language courses with particular emphasis on the advancement of their speaking and writing proficiency in German. Through a task-based approach the course aims to assist students in learning to write and speak German with level-appropriate fluency and accuracy. This course will also provide students with ample opportunity to increase their reading command of German through an authentic literary work and short stories by prominent German-speaking authors. The course language is German and class sessions will consist of communicative activities and practices. The learning of the German language will occur through completion of tasks in which students use the level-specific grammatical structures in different formats and circumstances (e.g. writing and oral projects) while receiving little or no direct lecture on German grammar. The delivery and practice of factual information on grammatical structures are integral to the course and thus instructors will highlight them to the extent to help students achieve the course objectives. The class meets twice in a regular classroom and twice in a computer-lab throughout the semester where students will be exposed to computer-mediated language instruction and work on various computer-based projects. Film viewing and discussions will be incorporated into the course, as deemed necessary by the instructors. Attendance and preparation are mandatory and homework is assigned on a regular basis.

Communism is one of the most powerful ideologies to have ascended in the modern period of history. Fashioned from Marxist philosophy, communism was embraced in the twentieth century to over one billion people from the former USSR, to China, to South Asia, to Africa, to Latin America, and by some here in the U.S. Unquestionably, the institutionalization of communist regimes has left an indelible mark on world history. This course will explore the writings of Marx and his advocates, notably Engels and Lenin, and strive to understand why the first communist regime emerged in the unlikeliest of places: Russia. Using the Soviet Union as a case study, we will examine how Marxist principles were either applied or transformed in the construction of the first communist society. By examining the history of the Soviet Union, including its spectacular and rapid demise, we will come to a greater understanding of communist principles and of the dynamics of capitalism as well. As a counter-example, we will also focus on the Chinese experience of Communism and contrast the divergent paths to reform that have been implemented there. The goal of the class is twofold: to become familiar with the principles of communism by examining their application primarily in the USSR, Eastern Europe and China, and to come to a greater understanding of the dynamics of a capitalist system. The course grade will be determined by the student\'s performance on in-class essay exams, a research paper, the comprehensive final exam (essays and short answer), participation in class discussions, and regular attendance.

Although individual versions of the course may vary in emphasis, these changes are recognized as vital to Europe\'s significance in the modern world. A major teaching goal of the course is the use of historical evidence, in the form of documents, to build interpretations of the past. A book of documents and an additional course packet supply this evidence and serve as the focus of the weekly discussion classes. There are weekly reading quizzes to ensure preparation and to provide questions for the start of discussion. A textbook and lectures supply the overviews and broad themes of the course.

It explores the unique Chinese ways and means of making sense of the world and the human condition by probing China&amp;rsquo;s philosophical and religious traditions. It reveals the conscious life of the Chinese in matters moral, ethical, aesthetic and metaphysical. Moreover, by showing the unity, diversity, continuity and discontinuity in Chinese thought throughout the ages, this course debunks the popular &amp;ldquo;Orientalist&amp;rdquo; myth that Chinese culture had been a hermetically sealed and stagnant monolith until the modern era when Western influences became dominant.</p>"},

This course seeks to equip students to teach Chinese history with a multi-ethnic dimension while also examining the ethnically diverse borderland regions of Tibet, Chinese Central Asia, Mongolia and Manchuria. Students will explore administrative policies, imperial rituals, political structures and legal codes related to the non-Han Chinese peoples to shift away from a &amp;lsquo;palace view&amp;rsquo; of the imperial court. In this way, the more traditional notions of Qing diplomacy that highlights tributary states and static notions of center-periphery relations will be infused with a much more nuanced ethnic dimension. Major topics to be covered will include the expansion of frontier and borderlands policies; how ethnicity was perceived in the borderlands vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the imperial court; what recent theoretical concepts have been employed to recast the traditional understanding of Qing borderlands; the evolution of China&amp;rsquo;s governance and indigenous rule within the borderlands; and finally how gender, marriage, and the eroticization of China&amp;rsquo;s borderlands influences China&amp;rsquo;s characterization of the non-Chinese border populations. The overarching theme will be one that seeks to throw into relief the strong ethnic diversity of late imperial China thus contrasting the notion of China as ethnically monolithic with the reality of an ethnically diverse empire. Students will be asked to explore the power of acculturation, weigh the impact of government-sponsored in-migration of Han Chinese, and develop an awareness of indigenous resistance and autonomy. On a methodological level, the study of China&amp;rsquo;s ethno-history combines several disciplines such as anthropology, political science, and religious studies with different subfields of history, ranging from economic to political, social, and cultural history. The merits and pitfalls of interdisciplinary approaches and the use of theory will be explored. The research papers will take the transnational dimension of late imperial China history into account and will rely on primary material and secondary studies from at least one other discipline. Students will have the option to use this course as a research seminar, conducting primary document research alongside their historiographic readings.

In this course we will trace continuity and change in Jewish traditions from ancient to modern times, and across different regions. Taking into account inter-cultural contact and historical events -- ranging in place from the Middle East to Muslim Spain to Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, and in time from the ancient world to the medieval era, the Holocaust, and contemporary Israel and the U.S. -- we will explore developments in Jewish history, literature, and culture. The course considers topics such as the attitudes other groups have had toward Jews (and vice-versa), the question of whether Jewish identity is a race, a religion, or an ethnicity, the dilemmas Jews face today, and the ways that Jews in many diverse settings have balanced change and continuity. We will explore the factors that shape Jewish experience in different times and places, the diversities within and among Jewish lifestyles, and the ways in which events and interactions with other peoples have influenced the development of Jewish civilization. Finally, we will consider the dilemmas Jews face today in terms of the preservation of their identity and traditions. The course includes class discussion.

In Part One of the course, we will examine the ancient literary genre of apocalypse, which was popular in the Ancient Near East from around 200 BCE to 200 CE, especially in Jewish and Christian writings both in the Bible (e.g., Daniel and Revelation) and outside of it (e.g., First Enoch, the Apocalypse of Peter, and the Apocalypse of Paul).

J ST (PHIL/RL ST) 135 Ethics in Jewish Tradition and Thought (3) (GH;IL) This course takes as its starting point the idea that modern ethical frameworks are deeply rooted in the &amp;ldquo;soil&amp;rdquo; of older traditions. By examining the development of Jewish intellectual traditions and their roots in the Bible, it provides students with an opportunity to study ethics in a philosophically textured, culturally rich, and historically informed way. And by focusing on Jewish engagement with the Bible, the course illuminates other traditions that derive from biblical monotheism: for example, those associated with Christianity, Islam, and the Enlightenment. The first part of the course takes up the idea of tradition and includes a study of biblical texts that serve as the foundation for key moral concepts. Following the traditional division of the scriptures, it examines questions of human identity and responsibility in the Torah, social ethics in the Prophets, and the quest for wisdom in the Writings. The final topic in this unit is the development of ethical tradition among the great sages of Jewish antiquity. The second unit shifts focus to the appropriation of tradition in modern Jewish thought. After reviewing important developments in Jewish thought in the medieval and early modern periods, it turns attention to the ways that some recent figures have addressed perennial concerns in light of commitments and ways of being that are integral to Jewish identity. By reading closely the works of such seminal thinkers as James Kugel, Joseph Soloveitchik, and Abraham Heschel, we will gain a deep acquaintance not only with important vocabulary but also with the ways that traditional words and concepts may be used dynamically to produce fresh ways of looking at questions in moral philosophy. Even when the influence of Judaism on a particular figure is not openly acknowledged in his work, as in the case of Sigmund Freud, he may be studied profitably, in a way that sheds light on characteristically Jewish ideas. Finally, the course turns in its third and final unit to applied ethics. The central question here is how Jewish tradition informs ethical reflection in a wide range of contemporary fields: specifically, environmental studies, social and sexual ethics, and legal and business ethics.</p>"},

These communities often constitute the points-of-contact between Jews and non-Jews, and in so doing sometimes transform Jews, non-Jews, and the relationships among them. Other such communities constitute experiments in Jewish lifeways and provide mainstream Jews with pilot projects for potential social and cultural change.

The communities studied will be located both in the U.S. and elsewhere in which Jews have lived as a minority community during modern times. The course will look at the founding, growth, and decline of such communities and at their social processes and institutions. It will explore how to understand and analyze such communities, which vary from one part of the world to another. The social world of Jewish communities, large and small, is a core interest of Penn State\'s Jewish Studies Program.

Entrepreneurship, which cultivates self-efficacy and personal agency as professional learning behaviors, is perhaps especially salient for the liberal arts, which tend not to be prescriptively careerist.

It also provides an overview of economic globalization and its impact on employment relations. Topics include global sweatshops, child labor, the diffusion of human resource practices, and corporate social responsibility. The first country case is Germany, which provides an example of a country with strong national unions and a highly developed system of works councils. The Swedish case exemplifies a long-tradition of centralized bargaining and tripartite relations that is now in transition. The third case, Japan, illustrates some of the initial experiences with team work, just-in-time production, and employee commitment through job security and training. China offers an example of a socialist system in transition that has become an economic powerhouse through massive export processing zones, government controlled unions, and wage competition. Brazil provides an important example of a Latin American country with a state dominated employee relations system. South Africa offers a case of highly politicized employment relations in a country in transition from extreme racial segregation to a democracy. Finally, India represents Asia\'s other economic powerhouse, with an English speaking workforce that is drawn to the booming call center industry and export-oriented production. The second half of the course looks at broader themes related to the topic of globalization. Sweatshops in Mexico and child labor in India examined alongside the diffusion of high-end human resource practices in Brazil. In this section, student will also study inter-governmental institutions such as the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund.

The course combines an initial discussion of both the nature and the breadth of workers&amp;rsquo; rights, both in terms of philosophical debates and institutional policy parameters. The course then examines how workers&amp;rsquo; rights have been defended through strategic corporate research and campaigns. The course will analyze the extent to which the legal grounding of workers&amp;rsquo; rights comes into harmony, or perhaps discord, with the actual state-based institutions that are said to implement labor laws and monitor their compliance. The course will also look at how workers&amp;rsquo; rights and labor standards are continuously challenged by MNCs and their supplier firms, especially in light of the hegemony of competition and economic liberalization of the present age. Taking cues from such developments, the course looks at how certain theories and perspectives may assist students in understanding more acutely how the gradually changing economic and industrial structures and production-distribution regimes impact on workers&amp;rsquo; rights. Answering this question will be done by examining recent theories derived from economic sociology and contemporary industrial relations, especially those that look at how GVCs impact lead firms, supply firms, states, workers and worker organizations. Specifically, the course will look at how workers&amp;rsquo; rights are impacted by types of foreign investment and types of economic upgrading processes taking place in developing countries and often being propelled by capital fractions that are headquartered in the industrialized world.The last segment of the course will explore labor solidarity in GVCs. It will pay particular attention to how strategic corporate research can inform international solidarity campaigns.</p>"},

A major focus of this course is on examining how languages are structured, how all languages are similare, how they differ, and how a language affects and is affected by the culture of its speakers and the sociopolitical context in which it is situated. The course begins by discussing the essential characteristics of every human language. It ends by examining the factors that have put languages at risk throughout history and what is causing them to become increasingly endangered. The course examines such issues as: speakers attitudes toward language through an examination of phenemonena close to home, like African American Vernacular English and various regional accents, how shared Linguistic practices create unity (South Africa, The Americas, Asia), what role languages play in maintaining difference and, indeed signaling socio-political diversity (Serbian versus Croatian, Hebrew, Yiddish, Afrikaans, Taiwanese, The Linguistic Geography of Africa), and how language reflects human origins, migrations, and history.LING 001 is a core course for the minor in Linguistics and it may also be used for the General Education requirement in Social/Behavioral Science, for a B.A. Social/Behavioral Science requirement, for the General Education Intercultural/International Competence requirement.The course is offered two times a year.

Linguistics is, broadly, the scientific study of language. At the heart of linguistics is the search for the unconscious knowledge that humans have about language(s), an understanding of the structure of language, and knowledge about how languages differ from each other. Speakers of all languages know a great deal about their language, usually without knowing that they possess such knowledge. For example, a speaker of American English possesses knowledge about word order: s/he understands that &amp;quot;Sarah admires the teacher&amp;quot; is grammatical, while &amp;quot;Admires Sarah teacher&amp;quot; the is not, and also that &amp;quot;The teacher admires Sarah&amp;quot; means something entirely different. A speaker knows that when someone asks a &amp;quot;yes-no question&amp;quot;, s/he typically reverses the order of words at the beginning of the sentence and that the voice goes up at the end of the sentence, as, for example, in &amp;quot;Are you going&amp;quot;?. Speakers also possess knowledge about the sounds of their language, e.g. which consonants can go together in a word. For example, speakers know that &amp;quot;slint&amp;quot; could be an English word, while &amp;quot;sbint&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;srint&amp;quot; could not. In addition, speakers know the rules of language use, such as when to issue a command (&amp;quot;Get me a glass of water&amp;quot;) and when to ask a question (&amp;quot;Could I have a glass of water, please&amp;quot;? Furthermore, they recognize dialects which are different from their own, and they can recognize earlier stages of their own language, as in a Shakesperian quotation, or a liturgical formula.This course equips students with the tools to investigate these aspects of language and language use. As a scientific discipline, linguistics employs strict methodologies to approach issues like the ones above. Students learn to transcribe speech phonetically, then to analyze the raw data into phonological statements about the sound system of languages. Likewise in word structure, students are equipped with the tools to segment words into their significant parts (called morphemes), which reveals interesting facts about how words are stored in memory. Through the study of syntax students learn about the unimaginable complexity of syntactic rules, and are taught the basics of how to unravel the mysteries of sentence structure. And when the whole complex of sounds, words and sentences is put together, rules of meaning are brought to bear, and the sentence is assigned a semantic reading. How this happens is discussed in the section on semantics. Linguistics 100 introduces these topics and provides enough information for students to understand the basics of the discipline.</p>"},

J ST (PHIL/RL ST) 135 Ethics in Jewish Tradition and Thought (3) (GH;IL) This course takes as its starting point the idea that modern ethical frameworks are deeply rooted in the &amp;ldquo;soil&amp;rdquo; of older traditions. By examining the development of Jewish intellectual traditions and their roots in the Bible, it provides students with an opportunity to study ethics in a philosophically textured, culturally rich, and historically informed way. And by focusing on Jewish engagement with the Bible, the course illuminates other traditions that derive from biblical monotheism: for example, those associated with Christianity, Islam, and the Enlightenment. The first part of the course takes up the idea of tradition and includes a study of biblical texts that serve as the foundation for key moral concepts. Following the traditional division of the scriptures, it examines questions of human identity and responsibility in the Torah, social ethics in the Prophets, and the quest for wisdom in the Writings. The final topic in this unit is the development of ethical tradition among the great sages of Jewish antiquity. The second unit shifts focus to the appropriation of tradition in modern Jewish thought. After reviewing important developments in Jewish thought in the medieval and early modern periods, it turns attention to the ways that some recent figures have addressed perennial concerns in light of commitments and ways of being that are integral to Jewish identity. By reading closely the works of such seminal thinkers as James Kugel, Joseph Soloveitchik, and Abraham Heschel, we will gain a deep acquaintance not only with important vocabulary but also with the ways that traditional words and concepts may be used dynamically to produce fresh ways of looking at questions in moral philosophy. Even when the influence of Judaism on a particular figure is not openly acknowledged in his work, as in the case of Sigmund Freud, he may be studied profitably, in a way that sheds light on characteristically Jewish ideas. Finally, the course turns in its third and final unit to applied ethics. The central question here is how Jewish tradition informs ethical reflection in a wide range of contemporary fields: specifically, environmental studies, social and sexual ethics, and legal and business ethics.</p>"},

So-called continental philosophy sought a ground of knowledge in phenomenology, the view that human subjective experience (&quot;phenomena&quot;) reveals essences, how things actually are. By mid-century, deconstructionist critique shattered confidence about the underlying distinctions assumed here. So-called analytic philosophy began the century with a commitment to eliminating metaphysical speculation in favor of narrowly empirical truths, on the model of scientific investigation; but the eventual unconvincingness of this view led to theories of knowledge and metaphysics that allowed for the absence of foundations. Rooted in this and earlier rejections of foundations, so-called pragmatism began as way to assess competing ideas by the difference they make in human action. A crisis in political foundations generated the social and philosophical movements of Marxism, critical race theory, and feminism. The ramifications of these crises continue to be acutely felt in contemporary philosophy, making the 20th century a period of particularly diverse and relevant resources.

Students learn about relevant data sources, as well as how to interpret data appearing in graphs and tables. The course consists of three parts. The first part of the course offers an overview of the elements of scientific inquiry including causal explanation, empirical verification, theories and hypotheses, and dependent and independent variables. The second part of the course examines dominant approaches to studying politics, including experiments; observational methods such as surveys and elite interviewing; formal models; archival research; and computational methods such as text analysis. Each approach will be presented using a similar format. Students will be introduced to the approach through a combination of lectures and assigned readings. They will then look at and learn about data sources suited to and consider questions or puzzles that can be addressed by each approach.

It introduces the field of political theory as an intellectual tradition that combines reflection on what political life is and what it should accomplish with investigation of the values manifest through existing political institutions and how those institutions can be best organized to achieve desired outcomes. Through analysis of selected works of major thinkers, beginning with the Ancient Greeks and extending through the contemporary period, students consider questions and problems that philosophers, political leaders and citizens have grappled with for millennia: What is a political community? What is justice? Who is included in the realm of justice? What is the best form of government? What do I owe to the state? What does the state owe to me? What is the proper purpose and scope of government? Students learn to critically engage arguments in canonical texts to understand both how they contributed to debates in their own time and how subsequent theorists and activists have interpreted them to articulate and challenge various forms of exclusion and oppression. Ultimately, students are invited to see political theory as a conversation across time to clarify concepts that are fundamental to the study and practice of politics yet remain contested, such as freedom, equality, democracy and justice, and to distinguish between the legitimate purposes of government and the arbitrary use of power. Through the course students will learn to employ and evaluate political concepts with care and precision so they can participate in that conversation productively as democratic citizens as well as in further study of political theory.

PL SC 414 Dictators and Their Demise (3) Dictators and Their Demise provides a broad exploration about how non-democratic governments throughout the world rule. We examine: the conditions that give rise to authoritarianism; the variety of authoritarian regimes; the strategies authoritarian leaders use to stay in power; the consequences of different types of authoritarianism for outcomes such as economic growth and human development; and the domestic and international sources of authoritarian demise. The course covers cases of authoritarian rule in: Chile, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, and the former Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo or DRC). The course builds knowledge about the governments under which most people in the Global South lived during the 20th century. Even today, roughly half of the world&amp;rsquo;s population lives under some form of non-democratic government. Yet almost all courses currently in the curriculum, particularly in the field of comparative politics, focus exclusively on democratic forms of government. This course therefore examines a new topic not currently offered in the curriculum. In additional to learning about different types of authoritarian rule, students form an understanding of how common foreign policy tools, such as economic sanctions, foreign aid, and human rights shaming, are likely to affect domestic politics in these countries. This knowledge helps students critically evaluate foreign policy relationships between democracies, such and the United States, and dictatorships. Course materials cover theoretical approaches to the study of authoritarian rule, in-depth case studies (including novels, biographies, and documentary), and empirical research. This course requires student presentations, weekly reading assignments, descriptive analysis of quantitative data in graphs, multiple written assignments, and a final take-home essay exam. Students develop analytic skills through the weekly written homework assignments in which they apply the broad theoretical concepts to analyze counter factual situations from specific cases of authoritarian rule. Oral presentations develop inter-personal skills and require students to research specific cases of authoritarian rule currently in the news. This helps students critically evaluate current events. Finally, the written assignments require students to develop skills working with real data. Students collect and graphically present basic descriptive data about economic and human development in non-democratic countries: economic data, infant mortality, literacy, and indicators of women&amp;rsquo;s well-being. Using real world data to make international comparisons helps students develop skills to form and articulate complex arguments, and teaches them the basics of research design.</p>"},

Specifically, it will analyze the extent to which the processes of state building, nation building, and international intervention have contributed to the incidence of both civil war and international conflict in Africa. We will begin with a review of several theoretical arguments on the causes of warfare in Africa and then turn to a discussion of theses on African political development. This course complements present offerings in international relations and comparative politics in the PLSC department and can serve as an advanced undergraduate offering in the African Studies concentration in AFR. The course directly complements our present offerings in international conflict given that we don\';t have a regularly offered course that focuses on conflict in a specific region. In addition, it will augment our comparative politics offerings with an examination of prominent issues in comparative politics such as political development, democracy, and modernization. The course will fulfill the IL requirement and encourage students understanding of the historical background as well as the political, economic, and cultural factors that influence African politics. African conflicts are often viewed as &quot;ethnic conflicts&quot; and in this class students have an opportunity to assess the extent to which ethnic, linguistic, or religious factors influence the likelihood of conflict and contribute to development in African states. Students will also be required to write essays evaluating the contribution of a range of theoretical arguments on Africa\';s conflicts in order to assess the degree to which cultural more than political or economic factors contribute to their onset. Students will then have the opportunity to conduct more extensive research on a specific African case to develop their analyses further. These exercises will often require that students reevaluate their beliefs about social identities such as race (e.g. in Rwanda the difference between Tutsi and Hutu is often viewed as a &quot;racial&quot; difference between black Africans, which is at odds with most Western conceptions of race). They also require students to challenge stereotypes regarding the subordination of African values in conflicts to a simple concern with &quot;tribe&quot;. Students will gain a broader knowledge and appreciation of the different values, traditions, and cultures evident in Africa and understand how these can both exacerbate and mitigate conflict.

PL SC 083S First-Year Seminar in Political Science (3) (GS;FYS)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Every first-year seminar in Political Science focuses on several of the major questions of the field. Many of these questions concern the constitutional arrangements of governments:What is it that we want governments to do, and what is the ideal government arrangement? Why does every nation (and every state and city) have somewhat different constitutional provisions for legislation, judicial, military and executive functions of government? What can we learn from careful comparisons of different types of government? What is unique to the American system and what are the consequences of this uniqueness?Other questions concern power: To what extent do wealthy individuals and wealthy organizations have disproportionate power in society? Is this appropriate or not? What is the impact of governmental attempts to limit the influence of the wealthy?We are also very much interested in the international system: What types of foreign policies and diplomatic strategies reduce the likelihood of war? What is the role of international organizations (such as the UN or World Bank) and multinational corporations in shaping conflicts between nations?Finally, we are interested in ordinary citizens: Do citizens know enough to formulate rational opinions on public issues? Why are many citizens apathetic? What motivates citizens to support one candidate over another or to favor particular policies and philosophies?Each first-year seminar will select a special topic of interest and use that topic to explore a subset of these questions in order to provide a challenging introduction to political science. In the course of doing so, each first-year seminar in political science will also introduce students to specialized materials (such as government documents), library resources, and appropriate electronic media. In addition, each seminar will emphasize the standards of evidence, logic, and critical thinking required to develop effective and persuasive reports and oral presentations. Students will write essay exams and one or more written reports on the relevant topic of their own choices. Class participation is required. The course fulfills both a first-year seminar and a general education or Bachelor of Arts social/behavioral science requirement. The course will be offered three times per year with a maximum of 20 seats per offering.In addition to the academic topic and issues of this course, students can expect to gain a general introduction to the University as an academic community and have the opportunity to explore their responsibilities as members of that community.

After a beginning period of domination by men, the rise of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s in the US gave impetus to the study of women and gender. Through both traditional and feminist research methods, psychologists have sought to clarify what is general among and between women and men, and what may be individualized to specific persons or groups. Conceptions of gender are also examined cross-culturally. Emphasis of study is upon those experiences that are specifically related to gender, such as stereotypes and expectations of femininity, violence against women, economic and work-related constraints, and pregnancy and childbirth. There will be two major evaluation methods used. One will be tests that will assess students\' knowledge and understanding of the major concepts, theories, and research findings. The other will be assignments that will provide the opportunity for students to apply, research, analyze, and discuss key areas of the course.

Personality psychology involves examining theories of human nature and evaluating them in an empirical fashion. Personality psychology begins with the observation that each person is (to paraphrase Harvard psychologists Kluckhohn and Murray) in certain respects (a) like all other persons, (b) like some other persons, and (c) like no other person. In other words, personality psychology concerns itself with the study of (a) universal aspects of human nature, (b) psychological traits and types, and (c) individual uniqueness. Principal goals of the discipline include constructing descriptive taxonomies of personality, inquiring into the evolutionary and developmental origins of human universals and individual differences, and assessing the impact of personality on the life course.This course aims to cultivate in students a breadth of understanding through an analysis of some of the major intellectual statements concerning human nature, viz., psychoanalysis, humanism, existentialism, symbolic interactionism, and Darwinism. Questions considered within the course include: How can we determine what might be a part of fundamental human nature? What are the relative contributions of conscious rationality and unconscious irrationality to human behavior? Can human behavior be explained by a finite set of motives? Do explanations in psychology differ in kind from explanations in the natural sciences? Can personality be quantified? How does one distinguish between sincerity, dissembling, and self-deception?Short-answer examinations and class participation are used to evaluate the degree to which students have successfully comprehended course material. Students should understand why it is difficult for a theorist to create a view of human nature that transcends the theorist\'s own personality and cultural/historical context, and how empirical research can help overcome these obstacles. Students are to learn how to identify and evaluate the assumptions (either implicit or explicit) about human nature and individual differences that underlie any social or behavioral science. By the end of the course, students should be able to describe the basic tenets of the major theories, to be able to compare and contrast the theories, and to be able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each theory. A good understanding of the course material will prepare students for advanced study in personality theory and measurement, as well providing a useful context for courses in abnormal, clinical, developmental, health, historical/philosophical, industrial/organizational, and social psychology, as well as for courses in other social sciences, certain humanities, and some applied fields such as business which at least tacitly presuppose some view of personality.Students are evaluated on examinations that include a mixture of short answer and objective questions. Individual instructors may supplement such examinations with other forms of evaluation as appropriate to section size and setting, such as in-class exercises and term papers. <a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20238" title="PSYCH&#160;238" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, \'PSYCH 238\');">PSYCH&#160;238</a> is an Additional Course in the PSYBA and PSYBS majors and may count toward the Psychology Minor.

The psychology of personal well-being and adjustment involves the application of the empirically derived principles of psychology to the problems of everyday behavior. As part of a scholarly discipline, scientific field, and professional activity, the overall focus of the course is the study of the psychological process of adapting to, coping with, and managing the problems, challenges, and demands of modern life. As an important area of psychological science, well-being and adjustment is an area of research in which investigators develop and systematically test theories about adjustment. As part of a profession, it involves the application of this empirically gained knowledge to enable people to respond to environmental pressures, both physical and psychological, and to cope with stress.This course provides an overview of the field of adjustment, including topics such as the way in which personality affects people\'s pattern of adjustment, the effect of stress on adjustment, the use of coping strategies to deal with stress, the adjustments people make in their social relationships (including how individuals view others, communication, behavior in groups, and intimate relationships, the development of gender roles, the emergence of sexuality, the phases of adult development, transitions in the world of work, and the way in which adjustment influences a person\'s psychological and physical wellness.Content is presented through a combination of lectures, readings, active learning activities, and demonstrations. Assessment is based on objective and essay exams taken in class, and on instructional and collaborative writing assignments (which include library and internet research, and a personal journal). Discussion and questions are encouraged in all sections. Along with personal contact, students have the opportunity to communicate with faculty members via e-mail.After taking this course students should be able to make more informed decisions about participating in future psychology courses and have a better understanding of adjustment psychology as a science, and the importance of adjustment in their own lives.Students will be evaluated on a combination of examinations, research projects and writing assignments. <a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20243" title="PSYCH&#160;243" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, \'PSYCH 243\');">PSYCH&#160;243</a> may be applied to the requirements of the Psychology BS and Psychology BA options and to the requirements of the Psychology minor.

This course is an introduction to cognition, an area of psychology that investigates the ways in which we acquire, store, create and use knowledge. Cognition includes a wide range of mental processes that are used every day in almost all human activities. These include attention, perception, memory, imagery, language, problem solving, creativity, and reasoning.Cognition refers to a theoretical approach in psychology that emphasizes the role of people\'s knowledge, reasoning, and expectations and this approach has had a broad influence on all areas of psychology. It also involves developing sophisticated methodologies to study processes that are not always observable. Cognitive research can be applied in order to improve mental functioning, e.g., developing programs for improving memory or cognitive rehabilitation for brain injury. It can also be used to address serious societal issues and problems such as understanding how people develop and use stereotypes. Cognitive psychology has applications to many fields including medicine, the legal system, education, and understanding mental disorders. In addition, cognitive psychology is part of the active interdisciplinary field of cognitive science that also includes disciplines such as philosophy, neuroscience and artificial intelligence.This course provides an overview of the field of cognitive psychology, including its research, theory, and application. Content is presented through a combination of lectures, readings, activities, and demonstrations. A major goal of the course is to show how the major questions in cognition are addressed through empirical research. It also promotes critical thinking and encourages students to apply this knowledge to enhance their lives.This course is a basic 200-level course for the psychology majors (PSYBA, PSHBA, PSHBS, APSCC, APSYC) at several campuses.

RL ST 001 Introduction to World Religious (3) (GH;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The academic study of religion is distinct from instruction in a religion, in that one seeks simply to learn about a religion, its history, texts, major personages, and belief claims. Because religions are always deeply intertwined with the entire cultural history of a region (linked with everything from weather and topography to political, social and economic history), studying a religion always means placing it in its larger cultural context. World Religions (RL ST 001) is an introduction to the religions of the world, past and present. After an introduction to the academic study of religion and various aspects of the field (methods, history, problems), the course begins a more--or--less chronological progression from the ancient world to our contemporary times. Each religion (e.g.: Ancient Near Eastern; Greek and Roman; Hinduism; Buddhism; Judaism; Christianity; Islam; NRMs [&amp;quot;New Religious Movements&amp;quot;]) is placed in its historical, social, and cultural context. The questions that arise in the course of such study are profound (e.g.: how have various religions answered the major questions of life: the question of the meaning of life; the question of evil; the question of how one defines &amp;quot;moral&amp;quot; behavior; the question of how one deals with others who may have a different religion or different morality; etc.), and can be of great help in critically examining one\'s own views and presuppositions about such matters. The student should leave the course with a good grasp of the variety of answers given by human beings to these &amp;quot;religious&amp;quot; questions over the centuries; how religions are linked to their cultures; how religions change and transform themselves; and how religions function within a culture, including our own. This should provide the student an excellent framework within which to reflect on his or her own religious experience, and prepare the student for mature, sophisticated interaction with the topic of religion later in life. An example of evaluation may be: Evaluation based on discussion, quizzes, mid-term and final exam.

CAMS 044 CAMS (RL ST) 044 Ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian Mythology (3) (GH;IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course introduces students to a selection of major ancient Mediterranean and Egyptian myths, gods, and goddesses. Ancient Canaan, Mesopotamia, and Egypt (geographically approximating the contemporary Middle East) were primary locations for the development-beginning already in the fourth millennium B.C.E.-of highly complex urban civilizations, many of which persisted until the turn of the Era. These ancient societies were responsible for notable technological achievements, such as writing, sophisticated irrigation systems, and the wheel, and for notable cultural achievements, such as impressive legal codes, highly developed astronomical research, and complex religious systems. This course will acquaint students with some major religious writings stemming from these fascinating old world cultures. The class discusses in some detail a limited range of stories about the divine realm, creation, the flood, kingship, life and death, and sexuality. The course pursues such comparisons by studying myths against the background of the different cultures that produce them. Because a number of these religious myths are historically related, the course will also critically compare the similarities and the differences between them. To underscore how important historical and geographic settings are to understanding these stories, the course uses different techniques of instruction such as small group discussions, slides, lectures, and films.Three of the world\'s major religions-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-trace their roots to the religions of the ancient Near East and Egypt. Hence, some attention will be paid to the similarities and differences between the views expressed in these myths and the views developed in classical Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. By grappling with issues such as divine character, self-identity, and female/male relationships in the ancient Mediterranean world, students will be better acquainted with how classical Judaism, Christianity, and Islam innovate beyond the religious heritage to which they are indebted.</p>"},

Throughout its history, this &quot;city of peace&quot; was a focal point attracting numerous cultures and peoples, the latter sometimes as prophets and more often as conquerors. The reasons for Jerusalem\'s centrality and significance during the past five millennia as a heavenly and earthly capital are explored in this course. The course curriculum will survey the religious, political, archaeological and historical record of ancient Jerusalem, beginning with its earliest settlement during the fourth and third millennia BC. Jerusalem\'s urbanization in the second millennium BC, its role as the capital of biblical Israel and Judah during the First and Second Temple periods, and its transformation as a center of Christianity and later Islam are studied utilizing the testimony of artifacts, architecture, and iconography in relation to the written word. Throughout the ages and continuing into the 21st century, Jerusalem remains a contested city for the three monotheistic faiths. The holy city\'s impact on the politics of the modern Middle East will be critically examined in light of Jerusalem\'s history and recent archaeological discoveries and their modern-day interpretation.

Introductory Sociology provides perspectives and information useful in understanding all societies. The major theories (functionalism, conflict, and symbolic interactionism) and concepts provide the foundation upon which the remaining material rests. Learning how sociologists do research provides the tools for understanding the production of knowledge and for evaluating the validity of sociological assertions. Familiarity with systematic theorizing and conceptual development, along with some comprehension of the nature of the scientific method as it is applied in sociology, enhances critical reasoning. To promote a more complete understanding of human social life, both in its inherent constraints and in the opportunities it provides; the nature and reality of culture and social structure are explored. The study of socialization provides perspectives on how one becomes a member of society. Exploring social interaction adds insight into the formation of the social self and the salience of group identities and norms. Ending this first section with a discussion of social control highlights the forces of stability and change in society. The course then progresses to considerations of social stratification and inequality. The nature of privilege and oppression are discussed and considered in the specific contexts of race, ethnicity, gender, and age. The focus then shifts to social institutions. The essential work of society is accomplished via its major institutions: family, education, health care, economy and work, religion, and politics. Applying theoretical perspectives to the form and function of these institutions enhances an understanding of how different social structures provide varying constraints and opportunities to their inhabitants. Finally, considering large-scale forces for change provides a platform to comprehend where human societies have been, are now, and might be headed. Throughout the course, the lectures as well as the textbook draw amply on cross-cultural and cross-national material. In addition, the course emphasizes the complexity of human social life and describes the many variables (social structural, cultural, interpersonal, and psychological) that influence behavior. A special component of the course deals with topics pertinent to the social behavior and norms of students of the ages typically taking this course. Depending on the faculty member, these topics could include sexual behavior, alcohol use, and problems in interpersonal relationships. Discussion and questions are encouraged in all sections. Sections of this course may include group research projects, debates, and library or internet-based research.

The course focuses on the social construction of gender and the impact of gender on experiences in a variety of social contexts and institutions throughout the life course, including cross-cultural comparisons of gender expectations. An overriding objective is to help students better assess and analyze the effects of gender throughout history and in their everyday lives. Class sessions are a mixture of lectures, discussions, group exercises, guest speakers, and films designed to engage the students in the learning process. Each session helps students to critically evaluate the effects of gender discussed in their readings and experienced in their everyday lives. The evaluation tools used for this course extend this critical evaluation. Although the specific evaluation methods vary by sections, all sections use some form of reaction papers, book reviews, and/or journals. These writing assignments require students to demonstrate an understanding of the class readings, lectures, and activities, and to offer an evaluation and assessment of these readings and presentations.

This course has three objectives. First, the course will help you to think critically about issues related to race and ethnicity in American society. These issues include the meaning of race and ethnicity; the extent of racial and ethnic inequality in the U.S., the nature of racism, discrimination, and racial stereotyping; the pros and cons of affirmative action; the development of racial identity; differences between assimilation, amalgamation, and multiculturalism; and social and individual change with respect to race relations. The second objective is to foster a dialogue between you and other students about racist and ethnocentric attitudes and actions. The third objective is to encourage you to explore your own racial and ethnic identity and to understand how this identity reflects and shapes your life experiences. The course is offered in both a large and a small enrollment format. In large enrollment courses, you not only attend lectures, but also participate in weekly discussion groups run by teaching assistants. These discussion groups typically have between 10 and 15 students. Your course grade is based on a combination of objective examinations, participation in group discussions, and short writing assignments. One example of a written assignment involves weekly journals. Each of your journal entries (typewritten and one or two pages in length) will focus on personal reactions to course material and answers to questions posed by the instructor. The course also requires out-of-class attendance at two campus events related to race or ethnicity, such as films, speakers, or workshops. For each event, a one-page written summary and personal reaction is required. Teaching assistants provide feedback on writing. Small (or moderate) sections of the course usually operate without separate discussion sections. In these courses, however, instructors set aside a substantial amount of class time for discussion of course material, equivalent to about one class session per week. During discussions, the class may remain together or divide into smaller discussion groups. After addressing a topic, you may be asked to submit a short written reaction to the issues raised in the discussion. Assessment is based partly on objective examinations. In addition, the course requires a library research project in which you explore in greater detail a controversial topic covered in class. These papers require the use of multiple sources (books, journal articles), excluding the textbooks for the course. The instructor provides written feedback, prior to the end of the semester, on your papers.

As such this course is an introduction to the topic with special focus on the major theories explaining criminal behavior including differential association, anomie, control theory and labeling theory. A key focus of the class is examining the most recent scientific research testing the basic theories. The students learn the various research techniques that have been used to study criminal behavior including crime statistics such as the Uniform Crime Report that serves as a monitor on crime trends. Several important areas of study that link understanding criminal behavior and its distribution across the social system are investigated including age, gender, race and ethnicity. One goal of the course is to promote a more complete understanding of crime and how it is enmeshed in human social life. The course concludes by using the knowledge base generated in the course to study the link of our understanding of criminal behavior and the emerging crime control policies of the past few decades. Finally, the course reviews the impact and effectiveness of some of these policies. Throughout the course, the lectures as well as the readings emphasize the complexity of explaining human behavior and criminal behavior in particular. One aspect of the course is the use of a term paper on the objective and subjective availability of crime to the student. This paper emphasizes the complexity of the student\'s social life and the role that these factors may have on whether they have engaged in criminal behavior and their analysis of the causes of their criminal behavior. This project personalizes the various theories and helps the student understand the importance of their social environment in whether they have or will engage in crime.

SOC 003 Introductory Social Psychology (3) (GS)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Social psychology is a discipline that bridges sociology and psychology. Sociology focuses on large-scale social trends while psychology emphasizes the individual organism and it\'s functioning. Social psychologists borrow perspectives and methods from both sociology and psychology. The major thrust, however, is on the influence of the social group areas such as socialization, social influence, conformity, group decision-making, interpersonal relationships, and social power. This course provides an overview of the major ideas and research streams that characterize modern social psychology. Eight major goals guide the form and content of this course: (1) Survey existing theory and research in contemporary social psychology, (2) Enhance students\' understanding of how social scientists conduct research, (3) Provide insight into the influence of social settings on human behavior, (4) Relate social psychology to other areas of social and behavioral science, (5) Help students to understand the interface between theory and research in social psychology, (6) Demonstrate the nature and outcomes of different cultural and sub-cultural processes, (7) Relate course material to contemporary personal and social problems, and (8) Provide opportunities for students to sharpen their critical thinking about human behavior. In general, this course is designed to enhance students\' understanding of themselves, other individuals, and the world in which they live. For example, after taking the course, students will have a better understanding of why people sometimes help others in trouble and sometimes ignore them, what kinds of situations promote conformity to authority, what factors result in anger and violence, why intergroup conflict is so pervasive, and how attitudes are acquired. Assessment is based on a combination of objective tests, a written group research project, individual papers, or a series of short research projects, depending on the instructor. All courses have at least one graded writing assignment. Group projects involve research on social influence. For example, students may use the Internet to study how political or religious groups attract supporters. Individual papers sometimes involve a critical book review. Alternatively, individual papers may be based on short research activities, such as examining the roles of women and men in rock videos or television commercials. Discussion and questions are encouraged in all sessions. Sociology 003 meets a general education requirement in the social and behavioral sciences. This course also provides a useful foundation for advanced social science courses in economics, marketing, political science, counseling, child development, and law enforcement. It is a prerequisite for Sociology 403: Advanced Social Psychology.</p>"},

It aims to expand our understanding of Jewish communities by focusing on those that are, alternatively, small, situated in out-of-the-way places, culturally outside the Jewish urban mainstream, or embedded in a larger society with markedly different values and traditions. These communities often constitute the points-of-contact between Jews and non-Jews, and in so doing sometimes transform Jews, non-Jews, and the relationships among them. Other such communities constitute experiments in Jewish lifeways and provide mainstream Jews with pilot projects for potential social and cultural change. This course will explore the significance of small, little-known, idiosyncratic, and anomalous Jewish communities on Jewish history and culture, and draw on them to instruct students on the social and cultural processes of small or unusual communities generally. The communities studied will be located both in the U.S. and elsewhere in which Jews have lived as a minority community during modern times. The course will look at the founding, growth, and decline of such communities and at their social processes and institutions. It will explore how to understand and analyze such communities, which vary from one part of the world to another. The social world of Jewish communities, large and small, is a core interest of Penn State\'s Jewish Studies Program. This course will complement the current offerings in Jewish Studies, strengthening the social, cultural, and contemporary perspectives available in the Program. It will provide students with an opportunity to explore individual experience and micro-level processes among Jews, and to study the dynamics of identity and survival. It will complement the current offerings in Sociology and Anthropology by affording an opportunity to focus on community-level social processes and by adding a course on contemporary Jewry. The course will integrate knowledge from a variety of sources and fields, promote intercultural understanding, and meet US and IL requirements. Materials will be interdisciplinary, and will include ethnographies, sociological studies, population studies, histories, and personal narratives. They will include primary texts, creative works, and scholarly analyses. The assignments will be structured to facilitate preliminary experience in independent analysis, library research, or field research. The course will be offered approximately once a year. Enrollment will be limited to 30 students in order to promote active, engaged learning.

These are campus wide 90 minute, peer facilitated small groups where trained undergraduate students (former <a href="/search/?P=SOC%20119" title="SOC&#160;119" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, \'SOC 119\');">SOC&#160;119</a> facilitators) help participants explore their personal stories, views, biases and roles in race relations using a version of the Socratic Method. These inquiry-based sessions are designed to discuss the true nature of race relations face to face in an ideologically neutral environment. The conversations are extremely popular with participants (85 percent rate them as valuable and worthwhile) and the number offered each year has grown from 140 to over 800 in just six years. Currently twenty facilitators work for the project, all Penn State undergraduate students. The WCP Mission Statement: The mission of the RRP is to create an ideologically neutral environment for dialogue where individuals can voice their true concerns about race relations and begin to address these concerns in a productive and meaningful way. WCP Philosophy: Our guiding assumption is that the articulation of one&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint on an issue is the beginning of greater understanding and knowledge of that subject. And the experience of doing so with others in a group setting creates a kind of synergy that advances critical thinking as well as bridge building.</p>"},

This course is designed to introduce students to the main societal issues facing humanity at the present time and in the foreseeable future. Although the course examines a number of social issues in the United States (such as crime and poverty), the course generally takes an international and inter-cultural perspective. The primary social issues that affect individuals and their children today are global, rather than national, in scope. For this reason, globalization is a recurring theme in the course. Discussion and questions are encouraged in all sections. Assessment is based partly on objective and short--answer tests taken in class, including a final examination. All sections also include writing assignments that involve either library or Internet research. For example, in one commonly used assignment, students write a paper describing and analyzing a serious social problem in some country other than the United States, such as Ireland, Egypt, New Zealand, Ethiopia, Argentina, or Indonesia. An alternative writing assignment requires that students investigate and describe a local problem in Centre County. Another variation requires students to research the views of other students and groups on campus and compose a letter to the Penn State university president about an issue or problem on campus involving student behavior. SOC 005 provides excellent preparation for most upper--level sociology courses.

There are three common strategies for estimating causal effects in observational data. One strategy is to condition on variables to block all the back-door paths from the causal variable to the outcome variable. Examples: matching (including propensity scores) and regression with control variables. A second strategy is to use exogenous variation to isolate the &amp;ldquo;unconfounded&amp;rdquo; covariation in the causal and outcome variables. Examples: instrumental variables (IVs), natural experiments, fixed effects. A third strategy is to isolate the mechanisms through which the causal variable operates to affect the outcome variable. These methods are becoming more standard in sociology and related fields. The course will cover the following methods: standard regression and its limitations; natural experiments and instrumental variables; counterfactual or potential outcomes methods; matching methods, including propensity scores; fixed-effects and random-effects; structural equation methods; mixed methods. The course is distinguished from other courses in the university by its focus on the use of statistical methods for causal inference. Whereas other courses describe regression or structural equation models as general methods for one\'s statistical toolkit, this course concentrates on when, and how, regression or structural equation approaches can be used to draw causal inferences from non-experimental data. Examples will be drawn from a variety of social science disciplines, including economics, political science, and criminology, as well as from sociology.</p>"},

Multilevel data arise when cases are sampled at two or more levels, with each lower level subsumed within the next higher, such as residents within neighborhoods within cities or individuals within families. Such data almost always violate the independence assumption of ordinary least squares regression, and in recent years a wealth of more appropriate techniques have become available. These methods bring the full flexibility of multiple regression analysis to the analysis of multilevel data, enabling scholars to address a broad range of research questions. This course thoroughly covers the basic multilevel regression model and also devotes considerable time to more advanced topics such as analysis of data with three or more levels, multilevel analysis of discrete dependent variables, and latent variables. Students will study examples in a broad range of substantive domains, with special attention to the unique research questions to which these methods give access. This is a course in the application of statistics to social science research, not a theoretical statistics course. Therefore the course will not include derivations and proofs, but rather the mathematics covered will be in the service of defining statistical models that correspond to useful research questions. The emphasis will be on understanding how to use these methods to do good research and on learning to interpret the results they provide. Several class sessions will be held in computer laboratories in order to train students in the use of statistical software that implements these methods.</p>"},

ANTH (SOC) 579 Spatial Demography (3)The improved application of spatial data and methods to demographic research is a critical methodological challenge facing demographers today. This graduate seminar is designed to focus on substantive demographic research topics while exposing sociologists and demographers to challenges in, and opportunities for, using geographic information systems (GIS), spatial analysis, and spatial statistics in their own research. Substantive foci will include readings and discussions of spatial perspectives on topics such as racial/ethnic segregation, spatial mismatch/entrapment, poverty, crime/delinquency, migration, health inequalities, wellbeing, maternal and child health, environmental justice, and population and environment relations. Similarly, the seminar will highlight connections between spatial concepts and data availability (e.g., Modifiable Areal Unit Problem - MAUP; data privacy), other emerging methodological approaches to studying society (e.g., contextual modeling, multi-level modeling and the area of neighborhood effects) as well as the integration of different types of data (e.g. qualitative data and quantitative data). Throughout the course lectures and discussions will be complemented with lab sessions introducing spatial analysis methods and GIS and spatial analysis software. The lab sessions will include the use of among other software GeoDa, CrimeStat, R, and ArcGIS (including Geostatistical Analyst and Spatial Analyst extensions). These lab sessions will introduce many methodological and technical issues relevant to spatial analysis (e.g., error, data validation, data integration, cartography, exploratory spatial data analysis, spatial regression modeling, geographically weighted regression, point pattern analysis and geostatistics). Assignments for the courses include up to two writing assignments, up to four lab assignments, and a final project which will be presented as a short 15-minute presentation as well as submitted as a term paper. The writing assignments will include an annotated bibliography/brief literature review within a selected demographic theme area and a profile of a well-known demographer and their adoption of spatial thinking/perspectives/methods. The lab assignments will focus on building geospatial databases, basic spatial analysis, exploratory spatial data analysis, and spatial regression modeling. The courses will include other labs and assignements that will be completed for no grade; these are inteded as mechanisms/opportunities for developing and enhancing familiarity with selected software, data resources, and analytic methods.</p>"},

Each section will focus on a well-defined body of scholarship that addresses a relatively specific topic while at the same time provide an opportunity for surveying broadly existing knowledge in the discipline. The specific content of the course will vary from offering to offering, and depending on the interests of the instructor, will introduce students to a sociological perspective on particular social issues. For example, one section examines racism and sexism as axes of privilege and oppression. Other sections may deal with major social institutions, such as the family or religion, or with fundamental social processes (e.g., demographic, social, and psychological). Finally, some sections may have a heavier policy emphasis--examining responses to social issues--while others might take a comparative or international approach. Each section will emphasize the development of discussion, writing, and analytical skills and will give students the opportunity to work individually and in small groups. Students can expect to receive a general introduction to the University as an academic community and to explore their responsibilities as members of that community. They will also become familiar with the learning tools and resources available to them, and they will be able to establish relationships with faculty and other students who share their academic interests.

The class addresses Latina/o participation/incorporation in the economy, the political system and public education, with attention to how public sphere participation is shaped by language, legal status, and connection to countries of origin. The class analyzes how Latina/o families are shaped by these social issues, with particular emphasis to how generation shapes life experiences.

It examines the contemporary effects of these historical issues and inquires into the common concerns of Latin American feminists and Latina feminists. It asks how theories and practices have diverged given different geographies, both between the U.S. and Latin America and within the U.S. The course then moves to the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S., when Chicano and Puerto Rican nationalist movements also gave rise to a feminist consciousness amongst Latinas; the conjuncture of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality is considered, with attention to how Latinas critiqued Anglo feminism&amp;rsquo;s narrow focus on gender. The next unit focuses on family formations, considering social science and feminist discourse on the issues of patriarchy. How have Latina feminists valued yet also rearticulated the traditional family? What critiques have made been against heterosexism? How have lesbians and gays formulated new kinds of families? How does migration shape family relations? The final section of the course explores how Latina artists in different genres have responded to and resisted traditional gendered and sexual roles.

Explorations of the interanimating systems of power in a given area or region includes attention to ideologies of gender, race, sexuality, colonialism, imperialism, health and welfare, any or all of which are either supported or disrupted by globalism. The course holds a feminist lens to issues such as: gender and sexualities; the politics of the body; ongoing effects of colonialism&amp;mdash;in theory and practice&amp;mdash;on women worldwide; women&amp;rsquo;s health; women and the environment; women&amp;rsquo;s labor; political economy; transnational migrations; global class relations; women and/in the media; violence against women; women and war; the global sex/human trafficking trades; silence and marginalization; citizenship politics; women in politics and activism around the globe.

Given that we no longer talk about &amp;ldquo;feminism&amp;rdquo; in the singular in the United States, lack of agreement on the priorities of feminists worldwide is even more acute, given diverse cultural, political and economic positions of women around the globe. Thus the course also asks students to resist the kinds of generalizations that have led to inadequate feminist response to urgent challenges faced by women around the world.

This course explores the history of modern, western ideas about sexual identity as manifested in literature, theater, film, and other narrative forms of popular culture. Drawing on the substantial body of &quot;queer theory&quot; generated by scholars in the humanities since the 1990s, this class examines sexuality not as a &quot;natural&quot; or consistent phenomenon, but as a set of beliefs that have changed over time and manifest themselves differently in different cultural and historical contexts. Starting in the late nineteenth century, scientific and medical authorities began categorizing individuals into sexual types based on their manifestations of gendered characteristics and their erotic attractions and practices. This medical typing corresponded with the development of subcultures associated with deviance from sexual norms; these subcultures produced a rich variety of texts, images, performances, and social forms, many of which became central to both popular and high culture. This course explores this rich archive, moving among media. It investigates constructions of sexual conformity and how sexual nonconformists positioned themselves in relation to cultural and medical group identities. It examines how distinctions between gendered, raced, and classed bodies were historically produced and culturally contested. It considers what commonalities gay identities may - or may not -- share with lesbian identities and how transgender and other identities have altered perceptions of sexual identity. The course also explores the relationship of the avant-garde to the mass media and how sexual subcultures have shaped literary and other cultural forms of expression. Comparative study of issues of sexual mobility beyond and between the borders of the United States expands the course\'s critical scope beyond dominant forms of western culture. This course does not propose definitive answers to the questions of identity it addresses. Instead it negotiates the ways sexualities have enabled individuals to articulate -- and disarticulate -- themselves within social bodies past and present. This course, therefore, has wide relevance for students interested in how group identities come into being and transform over time in dynamic relation to other historical forces. Exploring a wide variety of cultural forms associated with the history of sexual identity as well as a variety of interpretations of that history, this course opens students to an archive of literature, theater, film, and other narrative arts with the potential to inform and enrich their understandings of many kinds of challenges to regimes of normativity today.</p>"},

It examines the contemporary effects of these historical issues and inquires into the common concerns of Latin American feminists and Latina feminists. It asks how theories and practices have diverged given different geographies, both between the U.S. and Latin America and within the U.S. The course then moves to the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S., when Chicano and Puerto Rican nationalist movements also gave rise to a feminist consciousness amongst Latinas; the conjuncture of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality is considered, with attention to how Latinas critiqued Anglo feminism&amp;rsquo;s narrow focus on gender. The next unit focuses on family formations, considering social science and feminist discourse on the issues of patriarchy. How have Latina feminists valued yet also rearticulated the traditional family? What critiques have made been against heterosexism? How have lesbians and gays formulated new kinds of families?

Or do they sometimes have to modify the myths, archetypes, and literary conventions originated by their male precursors in order to adapt them to female experience? Is there such a thing as a distinctively female imagination, with a symbolic language of its own? Is there such a thing as a chain of literary influence linking women writers to each other? What are the strategies for coping with the anxieties of authorship? What is the interaction between gender and genre? In what ways are creativity and procreativity modes of defying prevailing ideologies? Does a woman\'s psychological development have an effect on the plots a woman novelist conceives? How does women\'s literature reflect the realities of women\'s lives? As a course in women\'s literature, ENGL/<a href="/search/?P=WMNST%20490" title="WMNST&#160;490" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, \'WMNST 490\');">WMNST&#160;490</a> concerns itself with questions of gender. In so far as some of these women writers are black or women of color, it concerns itself with questions of race and ethnicity. In as far as the course looks at women\'s literature in the context of men\'s literature, it is concerned with the inter-relationship between dominant (male) and non-dominant (female) culture in the United States as well as in Britain. In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Students should expect to complete a minimum of three written assignments in the course, two course papers, and an essay final exam in class. The papers each will ask students to choose a text to analyze in relationship to one of the thematic modules the course has chosen, for instance, to discuss how Virginia Woolf s Mrs. Dalloway analyzes the position of upper-middle class women in a particular moment in history when women had achieved the vote, but were still largely constrained by patriarchal social norms. In addition to written assignments, students will be evaluated on class discussion and general participation. The course not only prepares students for taking up literary and cultural analysis in English classes, but also in any other class that engages in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts, and in other classes in Women\'s Studies or in other Penn State departments that address the social, cultural, or ethical issues of gender. The course may be used as English Major elective credit or as credit towards the English Minor; it may also be used in the Women\'s Studies major and minor. It will be offered once a year with 40 seats per offering.</p>"},

WMNST 492W Current Feminist Issues This course is the capstone course for the Women\'s Studies major. We keep the course small (15-20 students) and offer it every spring. It is constructed to provide you the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills you have developed in Women\'s Studies to some of the major topics being addressed in current academic feminist discourse. The first goal of the course is for each student to become familiar with the major arguments and evidence regarding some of the current major topics in feminism. The second goal is for each student to learn more about the multidisciplinary perspectives of women\'s studies. The third goal of the course is for each student to develop and demonstrate her skill at carrying out feminist scholarship.There are two core elements of the course. The first is class discussion of readings addressing some of the major current feminist issues. Each year a new set of these topics is put together by the instructor, drawing upon the suggestions of other Women\'s Studies faculty and majors. The second core element of the course is each individual student doing a term paper. Work on these papers will take place both publicly and privately, so that everyone in the course will learn something about how feminist projects are constructed in the various disciplines represented by the students\' choices of topics for their papers.Because this is a W course, 2/3 of your grade will be based on writing assignments. Throughout the course, you will write short (2 page) papers on the readings that we will be discussing in our seminars. You will also write a term paper and some preliminary assignments related to it, including a topic justification paper, an annotated bibliography accompanied by a text description of the major themes identified in the bibliography, a class presentation on your paper topic, and the final 10-15 page paper. The other third of your grade will be based on your participation in seminar discussions.</p>"},

The course has been developed for both upper-class law students and students in the School of International Affairs for have completed their first year course work. Globalization is central to the study of the regulatory and policy framework of multinational corporations, and their relationships with states and other non-state actors. Since the early 1970s, with their huge market power and advanced R&amp;D capabilities, MNCs have been seen by some astute observers as purveyors of global efficiency, while at the same time being accused by others of using their transnational leverage and largesse to foster economic and technological dependency, especially among the developing nations. Ironically, however, this once &quot;highly politicized&quot; latter view seems to have given way to a more balanced perspective; most nations are scurrying around to ensure their economies can secure high levels of foreign investment from MNCs so they can better integrate with the mainstream of the international economy. With globalization\'s objectives of reducing the barriers to the movement of people, capital and technology across the globe, the MNC has been able to penetrate economies in virtually every part of the world. The result has been a fundamental shift in the relationship of multinational corporations to both law and public policy. With the deepening of the framework and legal structures of globalization, multinational corporations have been transformed from a mere object of law making, like individuals, to organizations that themselves now create law and legal structures. Additionally, the frameworks within which multinational corporations now serve as both objects and sources of law has expanded from relations only with the domestic legal orders of states to deep association with governance structures at the international level, including those of both public and private entities. Students will first consider the conceptual framework within which MNCs operate, including its business and legal forms, its relations with states and international organizations. Students will then consider MNC regulation by home and host states, and then examine the emerging system of international regulation by public bodies and through transnational systems of self regulation.</p>"},

The Trial Track involves representation of indigent criminal defendants accused of misdemeanor offenses in the Centre County Court of Common Pleas under the supervision of an attorney from the Centre County Public Defender Office. Students learn litigation, negotiation and advocacy skills as they represent defendants through all stages of a criminal case. This hands-on experience is accompanied by a classroom component designed to give students guidance, feedback and an open forum to discuss their cases and the various facets of defense work. The subject matter of the classroom component is designed to follow the progress of each student\'s cases as those cases work their way through the various stages of the criminal justice system. The Post-Conviction/ Amicus Track provides students with opportunities to not only represent indigent defendants in contested evidentiary hearings in the Centre County Court of Common Pleas, but also to advocate for broader changes in the criminal justice system through the filing of amicus briefs. While students learn a variety of trial skills in the context of hearings before a judge, they will also gain an appreciation for the vast array of problems in the justice system. This real-world experience is accompanied by a classroom component designed to foster practical skills as well as critical thinking. The Indigent Criminal Justice Practicum has two primary objectives: 1) provide criminal defendants who cannot afford private counsel with highly effective representation that is client-centered, professional and ethical, and 2) create a structured and supervised environment which enables each student to gain a detailed, working knowledge of how to represent a defendant; apply that knowledge to actual criminal cases; and gain feedback and reflection after each important stage of the case.

Specific emphases will be placed on the polymerization of biopolymers (polypeptides and polysaccharides) and the general relationships between conformation and biological function, the biochemistry of blood and blood surface interactions, the formation of teeth and bone and the relationships between microstructure, composition and function, the immune responses to implanted materials, the resorption of bone (osteoporosis),and the development of caries. The perspective placed on these topics will be that of materials science. The selection of ceramics for hard tissue prosthesis will be described. Orthopaedic and dental applications for ceramics will be discussed. Specific ceramic materials to be treated include dental porcelain, alumina- and zirconia-based ceramics, and bioglasses. Various classes of inorganic cements, gypsum, zinc phosphates, zinc carboxylates, silicates, and glass-ionomer cements will also be considered as ceramics. Hydroxyapatite, HAp-based composites and HAp-metal interactions will be discussed in particular. Relationships among physical properties, mechanical properties, and chemical interactions with biological fluids will be described.Dental and orthopaedic applications of metals will be described. The fracture toughness of metals, their electrochemical responses in vivo, and the nature of the interfacial interactions with hard tissues will be treated. Dental amalgams and the noble metals for dental applications will be considered. Metals and alloys, such as Ti, Co-Cr, and stainless steel used in prosthetic applications will be described and their properties and limitations discussed. The phenomenon of stress shielding and the immune responses associated with the accumulation of metallic and polymeric particulate debris in the vicinity of an implant will be discussed in particular.Polymeric materials are important in a broad range of biomedical applications. Among these are soft tissue prostheses, hemostatic agents, dental restoratives, bone replacement materials, and surgical adhesives. In some applications, it is desirable that a polymeric material biodegrade while in others property retention is desirable. Because of the spectrum of applications for polymers, the topics to be covered will be limited with the intent to concentrate on hemocompatible polymers, acrylics used as bone cements, polyethylene used as bearing surfaces in prostheses, and dental resins and bonding materials. Other relevant polymers and their applications will be discussed.</p>"},

The possibility of life beyond Earth is one of the great unsolved puzzles of human thought and has been debated for millenia. An answer would fundamentally change the relationship between the human race to the rest of the Universe. Advances in modern physics and astrophysics have dramatically changed and enriched the understanding of our cosmic surroundings, but have not yet produced an unambiguous evidence concerning the extraterrestrial life. Yet, significant progress has been made on certain aspects of the problem. Recent observations of protoplanetary disks around young stars, planets around solar-type stars and a rapidly spinning pulsar (a Penn State discovery), and pervasive organic molecules throughout the Galaxy give tantalizing albeit indirect, hints in favor of the existence of nonterrestrial life. &quot;Life in the Universe&quot; is envisioned to be an attractive choice for students who are interested in enriching and broadening their understanding of modern science.

The course material is conveyed, analyzed and discussed through lectures, invited talks, reading, essay writing, homework assignments and oral presentations. Lectures systematically cover the topics listed in the course outline at a level appropriate for non-science students, although Science and Engineering majors do take the course and perform at a higher technical level. While general understanding of astronomy from the prerequisite course is expected, the necessary physical and astrophysical concepts are reintroduced to assure a logical and coherent flow of information throughout the course. Videos are used to illustrate a number of topics, such as the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, physical conditions on planets of the Solar System, the detection of planets around a neutron star, and to evaluate the scientific content of science fiction movies. Invited talks by faculty from other departments enrich the course material with in-depth presentations of subjects such as habitable zones around stars, the basics and perspectives of space flight and the foundations of biological evolution.There has been some experimentation with activity and assessment strategies for the course. Some of the work involves quantitative analysis while other work requires qualitative synthesis of classroom experience with readings.

Students use restriction enzymes to cut two distinct DNA molecules into smaller fragments. The fragments are mixed and treated with the enzyme Ligase, which randomly combines small fragments into large recombinant DNA molecules in new combinations different in composition from either original molecule. The recombinant molecules, which include genes that confer drug resistance, are transformed intoE. coli cells that initially have no drug resistance. Cells that acquire recombinant DNA molecules are identified by selective plating on growth media containing drugs.

In addition to exploring historical and current cell biology research articles, students will develop two vital scientific skills; critical thinking as applied to experimental data and creative thinking about solving unresolved questions in cell biology. In this course students will read from journals to explore questions about cell biology and how cell biologists decipher cell functions. Instead of a general survey of cell biology, we delve into specific issues, often looking at &quot;classic&quot; papers describing how a specific phenomenon was first investigated to place current questions in context before progressing to the latest publications exploring how innovative techniques have been applied to deciphering cell function. The course is divided into units, each of which emphasizes content in a different area. Actual content may vary from year to year as the course is updated to reflect progress in a field of research. We have previously explored the general areas of cell membrane dynamics, intracellular protein trafficking, cell cycle regulation, cell signaling pathways and cancer cell biology. Finally, the course ends with a unit on stem cells and therapeutic cloning technology. A portion of the final unit is also devoted to discussing the ethical implications of stem cell research with an emphasis on how to make personal decisions about how our society should approach these issues. Reading guides are provided for each assignment to help students find and understand important points in reading assignments. Class periods are devoted to explanations and instructor-led discussions about the readings with an emphasis on understanding the questions, the methods used to approach the questions, the experimental results and the interpretations of the results. Furthermore, periodic class periods are dedicated to experimental approach exercises where students work in groups to practice posing new questions as suggested by our readings and proposing experiments to answer these questions. These skills are vital part of what cell biologists do daily, and these exercises provide practice in thinking like a scientist. Students have previously reported that by taking this course they acquired the ability to read and understand the primary literature and have gained an in-depth understanding about how to use various experimental techniques.</p>"},

Almost by definition, the vast majority of microorganisms are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Therefore, students must learn the correct use of the light microscope. Instruction in the proper care and maintenance of the microscope is provided. Students prepare and stain specimens using a number of methods designed to characterize microorganisms. The importance of working safely in a laboratory setting is emphasized throughout the course.Many skills are developed in this laboratory course. Aseptic (without contamination) technique is taught and is used to transfer organisms properly from one culture medium to another. A variety of media are used and the reasons for their use are explained. Students also learn how to calculate the number of bacteria in specimens such as water, soil or food. The course demonstrates ways to control microbial growth by means of temperature, osmotic pressure, pH, exposure to ultraviolet light and disinfectants. Students learn the importance of controlling microbial growth on their person and how failure to do so can lead to the spread of disease, especially in hospital settings. Other experiments illustrate methods used to preserve dairy products and test water for contamination.While students learn to isolate and identify organisms from their own body, other common bacteria found in or on the human body are also studied. A variety of diagnostic cultural and physiological tests are employed to identify organisms students have isolated. This simulates in a very real way the process physicians depend on for diagnosis of infectious diseases.

Bacteria existed long before higher life forms, so animals, including humans, evolved means to protect themselves from harmful bacteria while forming relationships with bacteria that are beneficial. These harmful and beneficial relationships are intimately connected to immunology, a field that has long been included in the study of microbiology. The study of disease-causing microbes includes the topics of how these organisms are spread and how they can be controlled using anti-bacterial and anti-viral agents. Selected diseases are used to explain the various mechanisms by which microbes are able to cause illness. Finally, the course also covers the role microorganisms play in the spoilage of foods and, more importantly, the myriad ways in which bacteria, yeast and fungi are used to manufacture such popular foods as breads, cheeses, wines, beers and many other fermented food and dairy products. At some point in the course, there is discussion of how microbes are used in the rapidly-expanding area of biotechnology and their potential for yielding products of benefit to agriculture and humankind.

A major stumbling block in a student\'s progress is learning how best to organize one\'s study so that both the details of these processes can be learned, along with how these processes fit together (i.e. integration). The second hurdle is learning how to use this information in a way that can solve real life problems and to communicate this process to others. This course is designed for students who have already mastered basic concepts in biology and who want to learn how to communicate their understanding to others who are learning these first principles.This course is unusual in that it has divergent goals. The students enrolled in this course will be trained to be more effective communicators. In the 21st century, it is critical that we train our students to be better at relating to the general population by using effective communication skills. In addition, the course will train the students to act as effective group leaders in peer learning programs so they become competent, comfortable, and confident in working with students of diverse background, learning styles and skill levels. The philosophy behind peer learning programs is that every student can improve their performance and with the help of a group leader, this goal can be realized. The group leaders play an integral role in the program that in that they are the connection between participant and course instructors. The group leaders will learn how to pass their skills on to other students in such a way as to encourage ownership of their education. Through workshops and biweekly meetings, the group leaders will learn about time management and study skills, test taking strategies, exam writing, working with students with divergent learning styles, and how to be multiculturally competent such that they are able to work with a diverse student population. They will facilitate learning through group activities and practice their leadership skills in a small group setting. Group leaders will be monitored through review of their weekly journals as well as observation of their groups by supervising faculty. The student developed exercises will be implemented and reviewed for effectiveness.</p>"},

The influence of mutualisms transcends levels of biological organization from cells to populations, communities and ecosystems. Mutualistic associations, such as our microbiome and agricultural symbioses, are critical for human health and welfare. Mutualistic symbioses played a fundamental role on the origin of the eukaryotic cells and the evolution of multicellularity. In addition to the key role played by mutualism in the evolution of complex lifeforms on earth, mutualistic association are instrumental to understand how some important ecosystems such coral reefs and hydrothermal vents function. Mutualistic symbioses are critical for nutrient cycling in the environment and the reproduction and dispersal of numerous plant and animal species. This course will focus on unifying concepts that cut across different forms of mutualism. We will explain and tests these concepts analyzing classic examples of mutualisms. We will define and categorize the diverse array of symbiosis occurring in nature. We will explore the evolutionary origins and implications of mutualistic symbiosis, investigate the population, community and ecosystem ecology of mutualisms and we will assess current anthropogenic threats to mutualisms, their potential for resilience and the role of mutualisms in conservation. Finally, we will explore in detail the metabolic linkages using selected nutritional symbiotic mutualisms examples. The course combines in-class and online teaching, as well as a weekly discussion session, in which the students are responsible for selecting one primary scientific article, prepare a brief presentation and lead a critical discussion session in front of the class.

The course will systematically explore mathematical ideas and tools used to study the natural world. Particular emphasis will be placed on the process of creating a mathematical model starting from a physical scenario. Typically this process will begin with an experiment either demonstrated in the W. G. Pritchard Lab or performed by the students in class.Once a particular model has been developed, students will use mathematical analysis and experimentation to determine the properties and relevance of the model, and to make predictions. Often the model can be satisfactory; however, many times one also finds new features of the system that are not adequately accounted for in the model, and the process begins again. It is this cycle the course will focus on. For a given phenomenon (e.g., flow of viscous fluid, pendulum motion) several models may be compared and contrasted, and possible simplifications will be discussed.A significant aspect of the course is its laboratory component, in which the students will perform experiments or observe demonstrations. However, the main emphasis will be placed on creating and rigorously analyzing the mathematical aspects of the models. Instead of presenting a finely tuned model for a given phenomenon, this course will try to convey some of the heuristic, intuitive, and mathematical ideas employed in modeling.Examples of physical systems to be considered include: simple and compound pendulum motion, chemical oscillations, water waves, and elastic behavior of polymer solutions.The course is open to a wide range of undergraduate as well as graduate students with majors in mathematics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. The course should be accessible to students with some basic knowledge of mathematical analysis and differential equations.

Logic forms the foundation of all mathematical reasoning. To prove a mathematical theorems, one deduces them step by step from basic principles, called axioms, or from other statements previously deduced. Each step of a proof has to be a logically valid rule, such as, for example, the modus ponens: &quot;If A holds, and A implies B, then B holds. In Math 457, students will learn how concepts such as axiom, theorem, proof, and truth can be formulated as a mathematical theory, that is, logical reasoning will be studied as a mathematical subject. The simplest kind of logical system is propositional logic. Here, the basic components are whole statements which are either true or false, and which can be combined using logical connectives such AND, OR, or NOT to form new statements. Its simple nature makes propositional logic a good system to introduce many of the basic ideas: syntax and semantics, proof systems, completeness and compactness. However, propositional logic does not capture mathematical reasoning adequately. Therefore, one considers (first-order) predicate logic. Students will learn how formulas are formed according to syntactical rules. They will also study how a mathematical theory is defined as a set of formulas, how a proof is formally defined, and what constitutes a proof system. The syntactical notions above are contrasted with mathematical semantics, which considers structures over which formulas can be interpreted. This way, one can rigorously define whether a formal statement is true in a given mathematical structure, in which case we say the structure is a model of the statement. For example, the integers with addition are a model of the statement &quot;for every x there exists a y such that x+y =0&quot;. A central goal of mathematical logic is to explore how the syntactical side (formulas, axioms, proof systems) and the semantical side (mathematical structures such as the additive group of integers) interact. Two fundamental results in this regard will be covered: the completeness theorem says that one can prove a statement from a set of axioms if and only if the statement is true in any structure satisfying all axioms. The compactness theorem, in turn, is an important consequence of the completeness theorem. It has profound implications for the existence and construction of mathematical structures. Students who would like to enroll in Math 457 are required to have some knowledge of mathematical proofs as provided in Math 311W.</p>"},

Many students come to the university with an interest in pursing a health profession but do not have a clear idea of what kind of work is involved in the particular profession of their choice. Moreover, students often are not aware that there are other health career options available. This one-credit course is targeted to all students that have a general interest in health and science, and may include students in the following majors: premedicine, science, biology, chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology, forensic science, nursing, kinesiology, nutrition, and biobehavioral health. Some of the professions discussed are: allopathic and osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, occupational therapy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, dentistry, maxillo-facial surgery, optometry, audiology, genetic counseling, nursing, podiatry, and pharmacy. In addition to describing the professions, time is spent talking about academic preparation for specific professions and the application process for admission to health profession schools. Furthermore, the nature of various health profession training programs are described , as well as how students obtain tuition funds for payment of such programs. One week&amp;rsquo;s topic generally focuses on health profession training outside the United States (e.g., foreign medical schools). This course is structured as a seminar course; all lectures are given by invited speakers. The speakers talk about the profession in general and may give specific information about the particular school they attend or currently work at. Students are encouraged to ask questions about the health careers and also to interact with the speakers after the class, where they might ask specific questions pertaining to their suitability as an applicant. The course will meet in the evenings, for one hour, one day a week, for 15 weeks. The students that enroll in this course receive a satisfactory or unsatisfactory grade based on attendance only (there are no exams, quizzes or written reports). Students may miss up to three classes during the fifteen week session. Therefore, students that attend twelve of the fifteen lectures will receive a satisfactory grade. If a student needs to miss class due to an evening exam, they will need to fill out an Excused Absence Form, which can be obtained from the instructor (no other activities are excusable except for athletic competitions for students in varsity teams).</p>"},

This course is designed to prepare peer-learning mentors for their role in facilitating student centered learning activities. The course content includes a blend of strategies for effective teaching and learning coupled with the opportunity to practice strategies of effective mentorship and feedback to peers and faculty. Through selected readings and course discussions students are introduced to the basic tenants of learning: the role of prior knowledge, the organization of knowledge into networks, the role motivation plays in learning, tools for the development of gaining mastery, effective practice and feedback, the importance of course climate, and the role metacognition plays in achieving self-regulated learning. Each of these topics is covered in one of the seven class periods. The students who have completed this course will be able to understand: - How prior knowledge affects learning and suggest alternate examples to help peers see the information through another perspective - How the organization of knowledge affects long term learning and share with peers the knowledge networks most commonly utilized in STEM disciplines - Factors that motivate student learning and apply this knowledge to assist faculty in motivating student engagement - How students develop mastery and assist peers to engage in activities that promote mastery through directed practice - How practice and feedback enhance learning and provide effective feedback when working with their peers - How course climate affects learning and provide faculty with valuable feedback in regard to the climate of their course learning spaces - How learners develop stronger metacognitive skills to be able to reflect on their own learning experiences and share this with their peers. Student mastery of the material is typically assessed through weekly written reflection assignments based on the readings and in class discussions. These reflections are graded and feedback is provided to assist students in growth in becoming effective learning facilitators. A final reflection assignment is typically given in which the students are asked to describe how these course topics will be put to use in the assignment as a learning assistant.</p>"},

In the business world, very large databases on commercial transactions have been generated by retailers. Huge amount of scientific data have been generated in various fields as well. For instance, the human genome database project has collected gigabytes of data on the human genetic code. The World Wide Web provides another example with billions of web pages consisting of textual and multimedia information that are used by millions of people. How to analyze huge bodies of data so that they can be understood and used efficiently remains a challenging problem. Data mining addresses this problem by providing techniques and software to automate the analysis and exploration of large complex data sets. Research on data mining have been pursued by researchers in a wide variety of fields, including statistics, machine learning, database management and data visualization.&amp;nbsp;This course on data mining will cover methodology, major software tools and applications in this field. By introducing principal ideas in statistical learning, the course will help students to understand conceptual underpinnings of methods in data mining. Considerable amount of effort will also be put on computational aspects of algorithm implementation. To make an algorithm efficient for handling very large scale data sets, issues such as algorithm scalability need to be carefully analyzed. Data mining and learning techniques developed in fields other than statistics, e.g., machine learning and signal processing, will also be introduced. Example topics include linear classification/regression, logistic regression, model regularization, dimension reduction, prototype methods, decision trees, mixture models, and hidden Markov models.&amp;nbsp;Students will be required to work on projects to practice applying existing software and to a certain extent, developing their own algorithms. Classes will be provided in three forms: lecture, project discussion, and special topic survey/research applications. Project discussion will enable students to share and compare ideas with each other and to receive specific guidance from the instructors. Efforts will be made to help students formulate real-world problems into mathematical models so that suitable algorithms can be applied with consideration of computational constraints. By surveying special topics, students will be exposed to massive literature and become more aware of recent research. Students are strongly encouraged to survey or present their own applications of data mining and statistical learning in graduate research and carry out discussions on data collection and problem formulation.&amp;nbsp;</p>"},
